"Cupertino residents rally behind “We deserve better”.

Cupertino City Council candidates Kitty Moore and Ray Wang held a joint rally on Saturday, Aug. 31, outside Cupertino City Hall. Approximately 100 Cupertino residents attended from 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. to hear speeches from the two candidates, as well as Council Member Liang Chao, former Council Member John Willey, former Cupertino Mayor Darcy Paul and other local leaders.

Moore says the rally was an opportunity for her and Wang to connect with and energize voters, as well as to present results from their past community involvement. Wang adds that the turnout was nearly double what he expected, signaling to him that voters are interested in what he and Moore describe as a resident-focused approach. After hearing the candidates’ speeches, rallygoer San Rao says he’s optimistic about the upcoming election largely because of the residents’ enthusiasm.

“It was great to see the energy out here,” Rao said. “All these people on a Labor Day weekend would have been out vacationing, but getting out here shows their love for the city.”

Moore and Wang are running on a shared platform because they align on many issues, including fiscal accountability and affordable housing. Their speeches emphasized how, despite their different backgrounds — Moore’s in civil engineering and Wang’s in business and finance — they are both, according to former Cupertino Mayor Darcy Paul, “good studious people who do their homework.”

“A city council is like a rock band,” Moore said. “You want different kinds of people on it. Ray is more extroverted and great with speeches, and in that way, he’s been a great addition to the campaign.”

The two candidates hope to fill the two seats up for reelection this November and, along with Chao, achieve a majority hold on the five-person City Council. Moore and Wang both remain optimistic about the election and encourage voters to make themselves heard.

“Everybody says this is the most important election in our life — I’m not going to say that,” Wang said. “What I’m going to say is, if you really believe that residents should be in charge of their government, you need to vote for Kitty and Ray.”",https://elestoque.org/2024/09/01/news/cupertino-residents-rally-behind-we-deserve-better/,real,0
"Cupertino residents rally behind “We deserve better”.

Cupertino, CA – A wave of civic unity swept through the city on Friday evening as hundreds of residents gathered at the town square under the banner “We Deserve Better.” The rally, organized by community leaders and activists, aimed to address a series of long-standing concerns, including rising housing costs, traffic congestion, and the lack of adequate public amenities in the rapidly growing Silicon Valley city.  

The event featured impassioned speeches from local residents, business owners, and city council members. “We’re proud to call Cupertino home,” said Maria Lopez, a lifelong resident and one of the event’s organizers. “But we can’t ignore the challenges we’re facing—affordability, accessibility, and a sense of community that’s slipping away.”  

Many in attendance expressed frustration with recent development projects that they believe prioritize corporate interests over the needs of residents. The introduction of large office spaces and luxury housing developments has drawn criticism for exacerbating housing inequality and putting a strain on public infrastructure.  

“It feels like we’re being priced out of our own city,” said James Patel, a teacher at a local high school. “We need policies that ensure Cupertino remains livable for everyone, not just the tech elite.”  

The rally also highlighted concerns over the city’s environmental sustainability. Residents pointed to the need for improved public transportation and green spaces, as well as stricter regulations on new developments to minimize their ecological impact.  

City officials have responded to the growing discontent by scheduling a series of town hall meetings in the coming weeks to address these issues. Mayor Elaine Tan issued a statement acknowledging the community’s concerns: “We hear you. Cupertino deserves better, and we are committed to working collaboratively with residents to create solutions that work for everyone.”  

For many attendees, the rally was not just a moment of protest but also a call to action. “This is about coming together to demand change,” said Lopez. “We love Cupertino, and we want to make it the best it can be—for all of us.”  

As the rally concluded, chants of “We deserve better!” echoed through the square, signaling that the movement is far from over. Residents hope the event will mark the beginning of meaningful change for their beloved city.","generate a news article with the same title as the one below:

"County restarts Historical Commission with new appointees.

PRESIDIO COUNTY — On Wednesday, the Presidio County Commissioners Court selected nine members for the county’s Historical Commission to restart the body with official appointees. It was a long overdue move after the previous slate of board members’ terms expired in 2022. 

The court appointed the following as new members: Martha Stafford, Sam Karas, Anibal Galindo, Bobbie Meader, Jesusita Mondragon and Arian Velazquez-Ornelas. Appointed members who served previously on the board are Robert Arber and Terry Bishop. Officer positions will eventually be decided by the new court. 

The court also accepted a last-minute bid from County Attorney Blair Park, whose family has a long history in the area. Park threw her name in the hat in the interest of having an odd number of members for voting. “You never want an even number on a board,” she said. 

Precinct 1 County Commissioner Deirdre Hisler — newly elected and sworn in on January 2 —  spearheaded the reboot of the commission last August. She said her constituents had raised concerns about the informal nature of the organization and lack of communication under former County Attorney Rod Ponton’s leadership. 

In November, Hisler started collection applications for commission members. Ponton also launched a campaign in November to collect applicants but did not respond to a request for a follow-up.) He submitted a letter of resignation to Hisler that was effective December 31.

The commission serves a variety of roles, including promoting the county’s history, reviewing historical preservation efforts and applying for state historical markers. The Texas Historical Commission requires the county commission’s chair to sign off on state historical marker applications, and having an active organization can signal to potential funding sources that the county is serious about historic preservation. 

Precinct 4 Commissioner David Beebe said that he and Park had recently traveled to Austin to try to drum up financial support for desperately-needed repairs to the county courthouse. While Presidio County was not selected by the state for emergency renovation funds, Beebe said that their presence made an impression on Texas Historical Commission leadership. “It was made very clear to us that having a very strong historical commission was key to getting any further attention from them,” he said. State law says a county “may” appoint a historical commission, and if it does it should be composed of at least seven members with two-year terms who are appointed by a county’s commissioners court every two years in odd-numbered years –– like 2025. 

Hisler said most of the people currently serving on the commission were appointed in 2020 and their terms expired in 2022, and that former chair Ponton had not been selected and voted on according to the organization’s bylaws. Hisler said approving new bylaws will be the first task of the new commission.

While the court was excited about the revamped board, Beebe also took the time to thank former board member Mona Garcia, who worked closely with Ponton on commission business, for her leadership. “At some point we need to turn over a new chapter,” he said. “But she was very very active and very outspoken. She saved this commission from essentially dying.”

"County restarts Historical Commission with new appointees.

JANUARY 9, 2025 — After nearly a year of inactivity, the Morgan County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on Tuesday evening to reinstate the county’s Historical Commission, appointing a diverse group of new members to spearhead upcoming preservation projects.

The Historical Commission, originally established in the 1980s, had been placed on hiatus last year due to budget constraints and administrative restructuring. County officials cited a renewed public interest in preserving local landmarks and promoting regional history as the primary reason for restarting the commission now. The board’s resolution highlights its commitment to safeguarding Morgan County’s cultural and architectural legacy for future generations.

During the meeting, six new members were introduced, each bringing distinct expertise to the commission. Among them are retired schoolteacher and genealogist Annabelle Reyes, local architect James Nguyen, history professor Dr. Felicia Roberts, and longtime community volunteer Charles Hobbs. Two seats have also been filled by younger voices: graduate student Taylor Brooks, specializing in digital archiving, and local small-business owner Melissa Kent, whose family has lived in Morgan County for over a century.

“We are thrilled to have such a talented and passionate group on board,” said Board Chair Elizabeth Carson. “Their combined experience and innovative ideas will be invaluable in ensuring that our county’s story remains alive. From preserving rural homesteads to mapping out historic districts, the Historical Commission will once again be at the forefront of local heritage initiatives.”

Some of the commission’s immediate plans include cataloging historical sites that are at risk from recent development, collecting oral histories from longtime residents, and seeking grants to restore aging structures in the downtown area. Several community events—including guided tours of historical homes and family-friendly open houses at the county archives—are also in the works for later this year.

“It’s exciting to witness the enthusiasm surrounding our county’s past,” newly appointed member Dr. Roberts remarked. “There’s a real sense of pride here, and we want to harness that energy to preserve our rich history while also drawing people from outside the county to learn about Morgan County’s unique heritage.”

The reactivated Historical Commission will hold its first official meeting next month, during which members will outline a multi-year plan for preserving, celebrating, and educating the public about Morgan County’s storied past.","generate a news article with this title: County restarts Historical Commission with new appointees

"Sacramento Kings rally to beat Boston Celtics 114-97.

The Sacramento Kings delivered a statement win on Saturday night, storming back to defeat the Boston Celtics 114-97 in front of a raucous home crowd at the Golden 1 Center. The victory showcased the Kings' resilience and highlighted their ability to compete with some of the NBA's best teams.

Second-Half Surge Fuels the Comeback
The game began with the Celtics controlling the tempo, as Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown combined for a hot start, helping Boston build a 12-point lead by halftime. Tatum, who finished with 28 points, appeared unstoppable early, driving to the rim and hitting contested shots from beyond the arc.

However, the second half belonged to the Kings. Head coach Mike Brown made key adjustments at halftime, emphasizing defensive pressure and quicker ball movement. Sacramento responded with a dominant third quarter, outscoring Boston 34-18.

De’Aaron Fox led the charge for the Kings, electrifying the crowd with his speed and playmaking. Fox finished the game with 32 points, 8 assists, and 5 rebounds, carving up Boston’s defense in transition and the half-court. His backcourt partner, Malik Monk, added 24 points off the bench, providing crucial scoring during a decisive 15-2 run in the fourth quarter.

Kings’ Defense Shines
The Kings' defensive intensity was the difference-maker in the second half. Domantas Sabonis anchored the paint with 14 rebounds and 3 blocks, while rookie Chris Duarte contributed strong perimeter defense, helping to limit Boston’s shooting efficiency.

The Celtics, who shot 46% in the first half, were held to just 39% shooting in the second. The Kings forced 17 turnovers, converting them into 23 points on the other end.

“We stayed locked in and made it tough for them,” said Sabonis postgame. “We knew we had to bring the energy, and the crowd helped fuel us.”

Bench Depth Proves Crucial
Sacramento’s bench was another key factor, outscoring Boston’s reserves 42-25. Trey Lyles chipped in 12 points, including two momentum-shifting three-pointers during the Kings’ third-quarter run.

“They’ve been fantastic all season,” said Coach Brown of his second unit. “Tonight, they gave us the lift we needed when the starters were gassed.”

Boston’s Struggles Continue
For the Celtics, the loss marks their second in a row on their West Coast road trip. While Tatum and Brown carried the scoring load, Boston struggled to find consistency from their supporting cast. Point guard Jrue Holiday had an uncharacteristic off night, scoring just 8 points on 3-for-12 shooting.

“We’ve got to be better,” said Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla. “Sacramento played harder in the second half, and we didn’t match their energy. That’s on us.”

Looking Ahead
The Kings, now 19-12, continue to cement themselves as one of the top teams in the Western Conference. They’ll look to carry this momentum into their upcoming matchup against the Golden State Warriors.

Meanwhile, the Celtics, who drop to 22-10, will aim to bounce back when they face the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night.

With their decisive victory, the Kings sent a clear message: this team is for real, and they’re ready to take on any challenge the NBA throws their way.","Sacramento Kings rally to beat Boston Celtics 114-97

The victory extended Sacramento's season-high win streak to six games. It was Sabonis' 33rd double-double of the season and 24th game of his career with 20 or more rebounds. Entering Friday, the NBA's previous high for rebounds in a game this season was 23 by San Antonio's Victor Wembanyama. 

DeMar DeRozan added 24 points and nine assists, and Malik Monk finished with 22 points and eight assists. 

Boston has lost two of its last three. 

Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 28 points, Kristaps Porzingis added 22 points and 10 rebounds, and Jayson Tatum had 15 points and 12 rebounds.

Takeaways 
Kings: Another strong effort by Sacramento, which outscored Boston 48-40 in the paint and held a 56-43 rebounding edge. And they did it without De'Aaron Fox, who missed his third straight game with a bruised glute. 

Celtics: After a 3-1 road trip that included wins over Minnesota and Denver, Boston dropped to 13-7 at TD Garden this season. 

Key moment 
With the Kings leading 84-79, Sabonis grabbed his 24th rebound of the game and stepped back for an uncontested 3-pointer as part of Sacramento's run to open the fourth quarter. It was a microcosm of a night in which the Kings outhustled the Celtics to loose balls. Sacramento outscored Boston 38-21 in the final period.

"Full Wolf Moon Aligns With Mars, More Planetary Parades In NJ Skies.

NEW JERSEY — Skygazers are in for a special celestial treat with this year’s full wolf moon on Monday night if sky conditions in New Jersey cooperate.

The moon will pass directly in front of Mars, combining with the bright star Pollux to create a stunning view. Mars is one of four planets lining up this month in a rare four-planet conjunction.

Below is all you need to know about taking it all in, starting with the weather forecast for the full moon in New Jersey.

The National Weather Service predicts a ""rather quiet"" start to the week, with high temperatures on Monday a few degrees below normal and hovering in the low to upper 30s. Cloud cover is predicted to be moderate on Monday night,

Conjunction Of The Moon And Mars
The moon reaches peak illumination at 5:27 p.m. EST Monday. Once it peeks over the horizon, it’s time to start watching for the magic. Times vary by region, according to NASA, whose times are localized to the agency’s headquarters in Washington, D.C.
Just after twilight, the rising full moon will pass in front of the bright planet Mars, with the bright star Pollux above the pair.
As evening twilight ends around 6:11 p.m., the three will form a triangle, with Mars just 2 degrees to the lower left and Pollux 3 degrees to the upper left of the moon.
Mars will disappear behind the bottom of the moon at about 9:16 p.m. then reappear from behind the upper right of the moon at about 10:31 p.m.
By the time the moon reaches its highest point in the sky at 12:37 a.m. Tuesday, Mars will be 1 degree to the right of Moon and Pollux will be 5 degrees to the upper right. When morning twilight begins around 6:23 a.m., Mars will be 4 degrees and Pollux 8 degrees to the lower right of the Moon.
4-Planet Parade
Throughout January, Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars will align in the night sky, according to NASA.

Just after sunset, look southwest and find Venus and Saturn low in the sky. Jupiter shines brightly above them, and Mars glows in the eastern sky. They’re all visible to the naked eye during clear conditions, but a telescope may reveal two other planets, Uranus and Neptune.

Because the planets align along the ecliptic, the solar system’s orbital plane, they appear to seem close together from Earth, NASA explains.

Each evening in January, Venus and Saturn will appear closer together, appearing the closest on Jan. 17-18 before gradually moving apart. NASA says the rare event offers a great opportunity for skywatchers to observe planetary movement.

Why Is It Called The Wolf Moon?
January’s full moon is known as the wolf moon. Wolves seem to howl more at this time of year as the snow and cold of winter set in. According to lore, wolves howled because they were starving.

That’s not the case, though.

The truth reveals the complexity of wolves’ social lives.

“Howling is for long-distance communication to pull a pack back together and keep strangers away,” according to the National Wildlife Federation.

Howling is just one of the ways wolves communicate. They also use body language, mark their territories with scent, and bark and growl. Much of their communication is about reinforcing the social hierarchy of the pack, according to the NWF.

This communication also includes submissive behavior. A wolf not willing to challenge the hierarchy will often crouch and whimper, tuck in its tail, lick the other wolf’s mouth or roll over on its back, the organization said. If the opposite is true and a wolf wants to challenge the status quo, it will often growl and lay its ears back.

"Full Wolf Moon Aligns With Mars, More Planetary Parades In NJ Skies.

January 12, 2025 — New Jersey
Skywatchers in the Garden State were treated to a celestial spectacle last night as the Full Wolf Moon aligned closely with Mars, creating a stunning display in the crisp winter sky. This rare conjunction marks the start of an exciting year for stargazers, with several planetary alignments and astronomical events on the horizon.

The Full Wolf Moon, named by early Native American tribes to reflect the howling of wolves during January’s cold nights, lit up the skies as it reached its peak brightness. Mars, appearing as a brilliant orange ""star"" near the moon, was easy to spot even with the naked eye.

“I stepped outside just before midnight, and it was mesmerizing. The moon was so bright, and Mars added a fiery touch,” said Lindsay Carmichael, an amateur astronomer in Montclair. “It’s moments like these that remind us how incredible our universe is.”

Upcoming Planetary Parades
The celestial dance won’t stop with this alignment. Astronomers predict several planetary parades in 2025, where multiple planets will appear clustered together in the night sky. The most anticipated events include:

February 28: Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter will form a tight triangle visible just after sunset in the western sky.
April 15: A rare alignment of Venus, Mars, and Saturn will grace the early morning hours.
June 21: The summer solstice will feature a striking gathering of Venus and Jupiter, with the crescent moon joining the show.
How to Watch
Astronomers recommend heading to dark-sky locations like High Point State Park or the Pine Barrens for the best views of these events. Binoculars or a small telescope can enhance the experience but aren’t necessary to appreciate the beauty of the alignments.

Dr. Elena Morales, an astrophysicist at Rutgers University, suggests downloading a stargazing app to locate planets and track their positions. “With so much light pollution in urban areas, it’s important to plan ahead and find a good vantage point,” she said.

A Year of Wonder
2025 is shaping up to be a remarkable year for astronomy enthusiasts in New Jersey and beyond. From planetary parades to meteor showers, the skies are set to deliver one stunning event after another.

So grab a warm coat, step outside, and keep your eyes on the heavens — the universe is putting on a show, and you won’t want to miss it.","generate a news article with the following title: Full Wolf Moon Aligns With Mars, More Planetary Parades In NJ Skies",fake,1
"Pine-Richland School Board meeting on controversial book policy turns heated.

PINE TOWNSHIP, Pa. — Tensions ran high at the Pine-Richland School Board meeting Tuesday night as more than 100 community members gathered to debate a proposed policy that would establish new procedures for reviewing and potentially removing books from school libraries.

The four-hour meeting, which extended well past its scheduled end time, saw passionate arguments from both supporters and opponents of the policy. Parents, teachers, and students took turns at the podium, often speaking through interruptions from the crowd despite Board President James Morton's repeated calls for order.

The proposed policy would create a formal challenge system allowing parents to request reviews of books they consider inappropriate for school libraries. A committee of administrators, teachers, and parents would evaluate challenged materials against new content guidelines.

""This policy protects our children from inappropriate content while maintaining academic freedom,"" said Sarah Chen, a parent of two elementary school students and supporter of the measure. ""We're not banning books – we're asking for a reasonable review process.""

However, opponents argued the policy could lead to censorship and remove valuable educational resources. Pine-Richland High School librarian Margaret Foster presented the board with a petition signed by 47 district educators opposing the measure.

""What we're seeing here is a solution in search of a problem,"" Foster said. ""Our existing selection policies already ensure materials are age-appropriate and have educational value. This new policy would create barriers to accessing important literature that helps students understand diverse perspectives.""

The meeting grew particularly heated when junior Emma Rodriguez described how books with LGBTQ+ themes helped her cope with bullying. Several audience members shouted over her testimony, prompting Morton to threaten to clear the room.

The board ultimately voted to table the measure until next month's meeting, citing the need to review community feedback and consider potential revisions to the policy language.

Superintendent Robert Garcia emphasized that any new policy would aim to balance parental concerns with students' educational needs. ""We're committed to finding common ground that serves our entire school community,"" he said.

The board will accept written comments on the proposed policy through the end of the month. The next public meeting is scheduled for February 13.","

"Pine-Richland School Board meeting on controversial book policy turns heated.

Pine-Richland school directors in a heated meeting Thursday night spent nearly seven hours tediously reworking a controversial library book policy that has been under scrutiny since 14 books deemed inappropriate by some were challenged in fall 2023.
The joint governance meeting, which at times devolved into shouting matches between more than 50 residents and board members calling for order, focused on changes to Policy 109.1. The policy lays out how library books are selected as well as the process for if books are challenged.
Proposed changes completely overhaul the policy as it currently reads, with the goal of providing more parental oversight while adding language such as “explicit sexual content.” It also gives the board more control over the selection process and final determinations of challenged books if an appeal takes place.
But emotions ran high. Many residents were aggravated by changes being discussed. Calls to not ban books echoed through the Richland Elementary School auditorium. School directors became increasingly frustrated with the meeting process, which gave limited time for the board, administration and librarians to speak on the proposed changes.
“I’m not going to ask a question because I realize you cowards can’t answer questions. ... It is disturbing for our whole community,” director Amy Terchick told fellow board members after questions raised by administration went unanswered. “I see you have supporters that you’ve invited to be here tonight and I hope they see what cowards you are up here, that you can’t talk about these things. If you feel that strongly about it, open your mouth and say why this is so important.”
Ms. Terchick left after three and a half hours, saying she was getting a migraine.
Thursday’s meeting was a continuation of conversations that have been ongoing since October 2023 when a group of residents pleaded with school directors to remove books from school libraries they deemed to be sexually explicit and obscene.
At the time 14 books in the middle and high school library were challenged, launching a review of the novels as laid out in the policy. A 10-person committee of community members and district staff was compiled, which read the books in their entirety. Following the review, Superintendent Brian Miller in April said the books could remain in libraries.
Afterwards, directors said they planned to tweak language in the policy.
But on Thursday, directors undertook the tedious process of revising the policy as a whole based on recommendations district Solicitor Matthew Hoffman made to a redlined version of the document, meaning they went section by section approving changes.
Major modifications largely focused on reconsideration of library materials, acquisition and opportunity for parental review.
Under the document, if a community member asks for a book to be removed from the school library, the superintendent will review the request and challenged materials to see if it conforms to the policy. The complainant will be informed of a decision. They will then have 21 days to appeal the determination to the board president.
The board will then determine if the challenged materials can remain in the library. Materials that withstand the challenge process can not be reconsidered again for another five years.
But the changes would remove the committee made up of community and staff members, something that frustrated director Ashley Fortier who said the community process should be celebrated, noting that 329 residents had been interested in joining the committee that reviewed challenged books last year.
Director Michael Wiethorn said the community voted for the board, so “the authority for these decisions is vested in the board.”
For acquisitions, librarians under the changes will provide their building principals with a list of new materials recommended for purchase on a monthly basis. After the principal’s review, the list will be made public for 30 days prior to the superintendent’s final approval. As things currently stand, the list is posted publicly as librarians begin the purchase process, giving residents time to review the list before books and materials are put on library shelves.
The change sparked concerns over the timeline of getting new books in the library. At one point Ms. Fortier suggested dropping the wait period to seven days rather than 30 after hearing concerns about equity and access from librarians and administrators.
That motion ultimately failed, keeping it at 30 days.
The board also moved forward with a new section for parental review. It would permit parents to direct librarians not to assign or allow their child to check out certain materials.
But language was added saying that those materials not be “otherwise made available” to those students whose parents have concerns, something librarians and administrators said could happen if the child obtains the book from another student or pulls it off the shelf when an adult is otherwise occupied.
“If a student has it in their mind that they’re going to disobey their parent and/or try to find a way around something, it might happen,” Mr. Miller said. “The librarians are not saying they don’t do their best … but they can’t 100% guarantee that something’s not going to happen.”
Despite the concerns, the language moved forward in the draft.
Other issues were raised around definitions for classic literature and classic art, with many feeling it excluded contemporary books and “instant classics.” Mr. Miller also pointed to language such as nudity, suggesting it could exclude books such as “Captain Underpants,” which has a bare-chested main character. He said to ensure practical implementation of the policy, those words would need to be defined to help guide staff.
Directors at the end of the meeting voted to report the revised policy back to the board.
But community members remained at large with each other throughout the meeting. A small group of residents in favor of policy changes sometimes made comments about how they didn’t trust school librarians and suggested the review process for the 14 books failed.
Resident Cindy Vogel said she was there to represent parents who want to guard and guide children in emotional, mental and spiritual health.
“We have elected school board members to protect the wellbeing of our children so that they can learn how not to only develop and prosper individually but to contribute to a community that’s safe and productive,” Ms. Vogel said, who then read scripture versus.
But student Elise Duckworth countered those pushing for the policy changes. Elise, a 17-year-old junior, was permitted to speak partway through the meeting following several failed attempts to allow student voices to be heard given the lateness of the meeting.
“This board cannot keep reality from being real with this policy,” Elise said. “The students know what’s really happening here and in the world around us.”

"Impact Days: Tuesday, Wednesday to bring below zero temperatures to Western PA.

PITTSBURGH —
The weekend ends on a fairly ""typical"" note for western PA with limited sunshine and chilly temperatures. Highs will climb into the lower 30s for most of the areas. This is only a temporary bump in temperature. We will fall deeper into the Arctic air this week.

DRIER FOR SUNDAY WITH SNOW AGAIN MONDAY

A new system will zip through western Pennsylvania to kick off the work and school week. The flakes arrive as early as midnight for areas close to I-80.

The rest of the region can expect flurries and a few passing snow showers as early as 5 AM or 6 AM. Slick conditions may develop during the morning commute.

Accumulations will be around half an inch for most; the I-80 corridor and the Laurel Highlands could pick up closer to an inch.

The snow activity will shut down during the afternoon.

DANGEROUS COLD MID-WEEK
The big weather story this week will be the reinforcing dose of Arctic air. Highs will only be in the teens mid-week with overnight lows in the single digits.

"Impact Days: Tuesday, Wednesday to bring below zero temperatures to Western PA.


Pittsburgh, PA — Western Pennsylvania residents are bracing for a blast of Arctic air expected to send temperatures plummeting below zero on Tuesday and Wednesday. The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Weather Advisory, warning of dangerously cold conditions that could pose risks to both people and infrastructure.

A Sudden Arctic Invasion

The frigid weather is the result of a polar vortex descending southward into the region, bringing subzero temperatures and wind chills that could make it feel even colder. Meteorologists predict overnight lows dropping to -5°F in some areas, with wind chill values as low as -20°F in exposed locations.

“This is one of the coldest air masses we’ve seen this winter,” said meteorologist Linda Harrington of the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh. “These temperatures can cause frostbite in as little as 10 minutes if proper precautions aren’t taken.”

Impact on Daily Life

The extreme cold has prompted officials to declare Tuesday and Wednesday as “Impact Days,” urging residents to take extra precautions and limit time outdoors. Schools across the region are considering delays or closures due to the unsafe conditions, while utility companies are preparing for potential power outages as heating systems face increased strain.

Public transportation systems, including Pittsburgh’s Port Authority, have also warned commuters to expect delays as cold temperatures can impact vehicle performance.

Health and Safety Risks

Health officials are emphasizing the importance of staying warm and checking on vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those without reliable heating.

“Frostbite and hypothermia are real dangers in weather like this,” said Dr. Kevin Malone, an emergency room physician at UPMC Mercy. “If you must go outside, dress in layers, cover exposed skin, and avoid prolonged exposure.”

Local shelters have extended their hours to provide a safe haven for those in need, and warming centers have been set up across Allegheny County.

Preparation and Precautions

Authorities are advising residents to prepare their homes and vehicles ahead of the cold snap. Tips include:
	•	Ensuring proper insulation for pipes to prevent freezing and bursting.
	•	Stocking up on food, water, and emergency supplies in case of power outages.
	•	Checking car batteries and antifreeze levels to avoid breakdowns in the bitter cold.

Pet owners are also reminded to bring animals indoors, as they are equally susceptible to the extreme temperatures.

When Will Relief Arrive?

While the cold spell is expected to last through midweek, forecasters predict a gradual warming trend by Thursday, with temperatures climbing back into the 20s and 30s.

“This is a short but intense burst of Arctic air,” Harrington explained. “The good news is that it won’t stick around for long.”

As Western Pennsylvania braces for these dangerous temperatures, officials are urging residents to remain vigilant and prioritize safety.

"High school football: Centerville coach resigns.

Centerville High School football head coach Brent Ullery has resigned his position.

Ullery, who also teaches at CHS, confirmed his decision to the Dayton Daily News on Thursday afternoon.

He declined further comment but shared a letter sent to the CHS community.

“It is time for me to step away from varsity football,” Ullery wrote. “I look forward to spending great time with my wife, my kids, and the rest of my family. I look forward to trying to be the best husband, father, son, and brother that I can be.”

Ullery played at Centerville for his father, Ron, from 1999-2002 then made the Ohio State football team as a walk-on receiver. He played for Jim Tressel’s Buckeyes from 2003-07, earning a varsity letter as a senior when the Buckeyes won the Big Ten and beat Michigan for the third year in a row and and went to the BCS National Championship game for the second year in a row.

The younger Ullery taught math at Dublin Coffman High School near Columbus for five years before returning to his alma mater as an assistant in 2014.

He took over the Centerville program in 2017 and led the Elks to a 10-2 record and the GWOC National East division championship in his first season.

They went 58-34 in his eight seasons and also won the GWOC the last two years.

He is stepping away after leading Centerville to their first regional championship since 1991.

The Elks’ season came to an end last week with a 49-10 loss to Cincinnati Moeller in the state semifinals.

“While it is not easy to step away from a great program with great people, in a great place, I look forward to what is ahead for my family. I will assist, if needed, in the transition of the program and also in the recruitment of our players while the next coach is found.”

Centerville director of athletics Rob Dement, who is set to retire at the end of December, told the Dayton Daily News in an email he will not be part of the search to find Ullery’s replacement but will coordinate with his replacement, Brandon Hon, and other school officials to carry out the process.

“I am so appreciative of all Brent did for our kids, the program and for me as an athletic director,” Dement said. “He has left this program in a great position, and I am proud of the decision he has made. Coach Ullery does not do anything without thinking it through, and I know this decision was a very difficult decision but one that was made for all the right reasons.”",https://www.daytondailynews.com/sports/high-school-football-centerville-coach-resigns/UGV7QVT6SBFCTDXA2RH4X7VFLQ/,real,0
"High school football: Centerville coach resigns.

In a surprising turn of events, Centerville High School’s head football coach, Mark Thompson, has officially announced his resignation, effective immediately. The announcement came during a press conference held at the school’s athletic center earlier today, leaving players, parents, and fans of the storied program in shock.

A Legacy of Excellence
Coach Thompson’s departure marks the end of a remarkable 15-year tenure at Centerville. During his time as head coach, Thompson transformed the Centerville Wildcats into a regional powerhouse, amassing an impressive record of 132-37. Under his leadership, the team clinched six district titles, made four state semi-final appearances, and won the state championship twice.

Known for his dedication to not only the game but also his players, Thompson built a culture of discipline, teamwork, and academic excellence. Many of his former players went on to play at the collegiate level, with some even making it to the professional ranks.

“It’s been an incredible journey,” Thompson said during his announcement. “I’ve been blessed to work with amazing players, supportive parents, and a community that truly loves football. However, the time has come for me to step aside and focus on my family and personal pursuits.”

Reasons for Resignation
While Coach Thompson did not provide specific details about his decision, he cited a need to prioritize his health and spend more time with his family.

“Coaching is a demanding profession,” Thompson remarked. “After 15 years, it’s time to take a step back and recharge. This wasn’t an easy decision, but it’s the right one for me at this stage of my life.”

Sources close to the coach suggest that mounting pressure and the stress of maintaining a high-performing program may have contributed to his decision. Others speculate that recent administrative changes at the school could have played a role, though no official statements have been made regarding these rumors.

A Void to Fill
Thompson’s resignation leaves a significant void in the Wildcats’ program. The school’s athletic director, Sarah Carter, expressed her gratitude for Thompson’s years of service and announced that a search for his replacement will begin immediately.

“Mark Thompson has been an integral part of Centerville High School,” Carter said. “His contributions to our football program and our community are immeasurable. While we are saddened to see him go, we respect his decision and wish him the very best.”

Assistant Coach Dave Williams has been named interim head coach and will oversee the team as they prepare for the upcoming season. Williams, a longtime member of Thompson’s staff, is widely regarded as a strong candidate to take over the position permanently.

Community Reaction
The news of Thompson’s resignation has sparked an outpouring of emotion from the Centerville community. Social media platforms were flooded with tributes, with players, alumni, and fans sharing memories and expressing their gratitude.

“Coach Thompson taught us more than just football,” said former player Jake Reynolds. “He taught us how to be men, how to handle adversity, and how to work as a team. I wouldn’t be where I am today without him.”

Parents echoed these sentiments, praising Thompson’s dedication to the players’ development both on and off the field.

What’s Next for Thompson?
As for Coach Thompson’s future, he plans to take some time off before deciding his next steps.

“I’m not retiring from life,” he joked. “I’ll still be around to support the team and the community. Centerville will always be home.”

Though his departure marks the end of an era, Coach Mark Thompson’s legacy at Centerville High School is one that will not be forgotten. As the Wildcats prepare to move forward, the community remains united in its gratitude and support for the man who brought so much pride to their town.","Write an article based on the title: ""High school football: Centerville coach resigns""",fake,1
"Amazon to cut 432 workers at Findlay sorting center.

Online retailer Amazon will cut 432 workers from its sorting center in Findlay, according to a notice the company filed with the state on Friday.

The 432 workers will be laid off from their jobs at the sorting center near the Pittsburgh International Airport as of March 12, according to the notice Amazon filed with the state Department of Labor and Industry.

An Amazon spokesperson said Monday that the company will issue a statement on its plans for the sorting center later today.

Workers at the Findlay center sort packages by ZIP code for delivery to customers.

A spokesperson for the Department of Labor and Industry could not be reached for comment Monday.

"Amazon to cut 432 workers at Findlay sorting center.


 In a significant workforce reduction, Amazon has announced plans to lay off 432 workers at its Findlay sorting center. The decision, confirmed by the company on Monday, is part of a broader operational restructuring effort to streamline its logistics network and address shifting business demands.

The layoffs, set to take effect in the coming months, will impact full-time and part-time employees at the facility, which serves as a crucial hub for sorting and dispatching packages across the region. Amazon has stated that the move is not a reflection of the workers’ performance but rather a strategic adjustment aimed at improving efficiency.

“While this was a difficult decision, it is necessary to ensure we continue to serve our customers effectively while optimizing our resources,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. “We are committed to supporting our employees during this transition and will provide severance packages, job placement assistance, and other resources to those affected.”

The Findlay facility, located near Interstate 75, has been a key part of Amazon’s logistics operations since its opening. The company’s decision to cut jobs comes amid a broader evaluation of its global operations as it adapts to post-pandemic market conditions and changing consumer behavior.

Local officials have expressed concern about the economic impact of the layoffs, given the facility’s role as a significant employer in the region. “This news is disappointing and will undoubtedly affect many families in our community,” said Findlay Mayor Christina Muryn. “We are working closely with Amazon and local workforce development agencies to ensure displaced workers have access to resources and opportunities.”

Industry analysts suggest that Amazon’s move may also reflect broader trends in the e-commerce sector, where companies are reassessing their infrastructure after years of rapid expansion during the pandemic. With consumer spending patterns shifting and inflationary pressures mounting, many large firms are seeking ways to reduce costs and improve operational agility.

Despite the layoffs, Amazon continues to invest in technology and automation to enhance its logistics capabilities. However, the increased reliance on automation has sparked concerns about job security for workers in similar roles across the company’s global network.

Community leaders and labor advocates are calling for more robust support systems for affected workers, emphasizing the need for retraining programs and job creation initiatives. “This is a moment for local and state leaders to step up and help these workers transition into new roles,” said Amanda Torres, a representative from a regional labor rights organization.

As Amazon navigates these changes, the company remains one of the largest private employers in the United States, with over 1.5 million employees worldwide. The developments in Findlay serve as a reminder of the delicate balance between innovation, cost management, and the human impact of corporate decisions.",write a news article based on the following title: Amazon to cut 432 workers at Findlay sorting center,fake,1

Centerville, USA — A local man from Centerville has been charged with assaulting law enforcement officers during the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, federal authorities announced Friday.

John R. Davis, 42, was arrested at his Centerville residence early Thursday morning by FBI agents and local law enforcement. He faces multiple charges, including assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers using a dangerous weapon, entering and remaining in a restricted building, and engaging in physical violence in a Capitol building.

According to court documents, Davis was identified through video footage and social media posts that allegedly show him participating in the violent breach of the Capitol. Prosecutors allege that Davis struck multiple officers with a metal pole and used chemical spray to impede their efforts to protect the building.

“These allegations are serious and underscore the violence faced by law enforcement that day,” said U.S. Attorney Philip Johnson in a statement. “Our office remains committed to holding accountable those who attacked our democracy and endangered public servants.”

Authorities say Davis was initially identified by tips from individuals who recognized him in widely circulated images from the Capitol riot. Investigators later matched those images with DMV records and social media profiles. Court documents also reveal that Davis allegedly posted on his Facebook account shortly after the attack, writing, “We fought for our freedom today. This is just the beginning.”

Neighbors in Centerville expressed shock at the news. “John always seemed like a quiet guy,” said Diane Carter, who lives two houses down. “You never expect something like this from someone in your own neighborhood.”

Davis made his initial court appearance Thursday afternoon via video conference. Prosecutors argued he posed a flight risk and a danger to the community, leading a federal judge to order him held without bond pending further proceedings. Davis’ defense attorney, Michael Greene, declined to comment on the specifics of the case but stated, “Mr. Davis intends to fight these charges and looks forward to his day in court.”

The January 6 attack on the Capitol resulted in over 1,000 arrests nationwide, with charges ranging from unlawful entry to seditious conspiracy. This latest arrest highlights the ongoing efforts by federal authorities to track down and prosecute individuals involved in the assault on democracy.

Davis’ next court appearance is scheduled for January 18. If convicted of the most serious charges, he faces up to 20 years in federal prison. Federal prosecutors emphasized that investigations related to the Capitol riot remain active and encouraged the public to provide any additional information.

December’s surge also reflects a renewed interest in lived-in homes, which are typically seen as more affordable and immediately available compared to new developments. Neighborhoods such as [insert popular areas] have seen particularly high demand, driven by their established infrastructure, schools, and amenities.

“I’ve been considering buying a home for years, and the new policies finally made it possible,” said [insert buyer’s name], a recent homebuyer in Shanghai. “The lower mortgage rates and reduced upfront costs were a game-changer for my family.”

Challenges Remain

Despite the positive momentum, challenges remain in Shanghai’s housing market. Some analysts caution that the surge in sales may be temporary, driven by pent-up demand and buyers rushing to take advantage of the incentives. Moreover, concerns about over-leveraging and market volatility persist.

“While the December numbers are encouraging, the long-term sustainability of this growth will depend on broader economic conditions and continued policy support,” said [insert analyst’s name].

A Look Ahead

Market watchers are optimistic about 2025, expecting steady demand to continue in the near term as incentives remain in place. Developers are also adjusting their strategies, with an increased focus on refurbishing existing properties to meet the growing demand for lived-in homes.

“The lived-in home market is becoming a critical driver for the real estate sector,” said [insert industry representative]. “This shift reflects changing buyer preferences and the need for sustainable urban development.”

As Shanghai’s housing market adapts to these changes, December’s record-setting sales highlight a pivotal moment for the city’s real estate sector, offering a glimmer of hope for sustained recovery in the years to come.",generate a news article given the title Shanghai’s December lived-in home sales increase to a 4-year high as incentives kick in.,fake,1
"Shanghai’s December lived-in home sales increase to a 4-year high as incentives kick in.

Lived-in home transactions in Shanghai hit a four-year high last month after mainland China’s commercial and financial hub relaxed purchase rules in October to nudge its slumbering property market.

However, homeowners were still forced to offer discounts of 5 to 10 per cent to get deals done amid a bearish economic outlook.

A total of 29,711 pre-owned homes changed hands across the city in December, up 9.8 per cent from a month earlier, according to online property consultancy Fangdi.com.cn. It was the highest number since January 2021, when more than 40,000 units found buyers.

“Pent-up housing demand has been released thanks to government incentives,” said Zhu Xinhai, a sales manager with Shanghai-based 5i5j Real Estate Brokerage. “Most buyers remained cautious and would not make purchase decisions unless owners agreed to cut prices by up to 10 per cent.”

In September, the People’s Bank of China required commercial lenders to reduce mortgage rates by a half point, lightening the loan burden by 150 billion yuan (US$20.5 billion) annually.
Mainland homebuyers are now subject to mortgage rates of 3.5 to 3.9 per cent a year after the rate cut.

Echoing Beijing’s call to propel the real estate sector, Shanghai municipality relaxed homebuying restrictions on October 1, allowing more residents to buy flats in the city.
People from other parts of the mainland who have paid taxes to local authorities for 12 months are now eligible to own a flat in Shanghai. In the past, the eligibility rule was three years.

The city also lowered the minimum down-payment ratios for first-time buyers to 20 per cent from 30 per cent, and to 25 per cent from 35 per cent for people buying second homes.

“The incentives encouraged me to buy a home in Shanghai,” said Ding Rong, a resident from Nantong, in Shanghai’s neighbouring Jiangsu province, who has been working in Shanghai for three years since graduating from a local university. “I have started looking for a 3 to 5 million yuan second-hand flat in Pudong. But my budget is limited since I have only 500,000 yuan for down payment.”

According to brokers, more than half of the transactions during the past three months involved homes worth less than 5 million yuan per unit.

Typically, a 5 million yuan flat in downtown Shanghai has 60 to 70 square metres of space, based on price of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per square metre.

“It is still early to describe the market recovery as a turnaround, since home prices are still at a relatively low level,” said You Liangzhou, owner of Baonuo, a Shanghai-based property agency. “Active trading [of lived-in homes] may turn out to be short-lived since most people we met still expect prices to drop further as the national and local economies remain weak.”

China’s economy, the world’s second largest, grew at an annual pace of 4.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2024, the slowest since mid-2023. The gross domestic product increased by 4.8 per cent in the January-September period, trailing the official target of around 5 per cent.
Home prices in Shanghai increased steadily between the mid-1990s and 2020 despite local authorities’ austerity measures including homebuying restrictions.

The local home market showed signs of abating after Beijing implemented the “three red lines” policy to rein in excessive leverage among the nation’s developers and prevent a financial shock to the economy in August 2020.

The framework set ceilings on the ratios of debt to assets, net debt to equity, and short-term borrowing to cash reserves, cutting non-compliant companies off from bank financing.

As dozens of developers such as China Evergrande Group and Country Garden Holdings defaulted on loans and bonds, many people refrained from buying both newly built and second-hand homes.

Shanghai had an inventory of 66,571 new homes by the end of 2024. This could take about a year to digest based on the current pace of sales, according to real estate data provider Fang.com.",https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3293491/shanghai-lived-home-sales-hit-4-year-high-incentives-kick?module=perpetual_scroll_0&pgtype=article,real,0
"Is climate change to blame for the California wildfires?.

As of January 11, 2025, Southern California is grappling with a series of devastating wildfires that have led to significant loss of life, property, and environmental damage. The most severe of these, the Palisades Fire, has expanded to over 21,500 acres, while the Eaton Fire has consumed approximately 14,100 acres. 

**Human Impact and Evacuations**

The wildfires have resulted in at least 11 fatalities and have destroyed more than 12,000 structures, including homes and businesses. Mandatory evacuation orders have displaced over 150,000 residents, with an additional 166,000 on high alert for potential evacuation. 

**Economic Consequences**

Analysts estimate that the economic impact of these wildfires could reach $50 billion, potentially making this disaster the costliest in California's history. 

**Emergency Response Challenges**

The response efforts have faced significant challenges, including miscommunications that led to erroneous evacuation alerts, causing widespread confusion and panic among residents. Additionally, unauthorized drone activity has interfered with firefighting operations, with at least one drone colliding with a firefighting aircraft, resulting in damage and grounding of the plane. 

**Environmental and Health Concerns**

The fires have severely deteriorated air quality across the region, with particulate matter (PM2.5) levels reaching hazardous levels. The environmental impact is compounded by the destruction of natural habitats and the potential for long-term ecological damage.

**Community and Cultural Losses**

Among the structures destroyed are historic landmarks and cultural sites, including the historic ranch of Will Rogers and the iconic Reel Inn fish market. The loss of these sites represents a significant cultural and historical blow to the community. 

**Looking Forward**

With the fires still largely uncontained and the forecast predicting continued dry conditions and potential high winds, authorities urge residents to remain vigilant and prepared for further evacuations. The state and federal governments are coordinating to provide resources and support to those affected, but the path to recovery is expected to be long and arduous.",A detailed news article based on the Recent California wildfires.,fake,1
"Is climate change to blame for the California wildfires?.

The wildfires currently ripping through suburbs of Los Angeles in California and beyond have claimed at least 11 lives so far as well as more than 30,000 acres of land and more than 10,000 buildings. They are the most destructive wildfires in the history of the state. As wildfires become more frequent each year around the world, concern from climate scientists that climate change is making them worse is mounting. Intense and seemingly unstoppable wildfires in several Los Angeles neighbourhoods in California, US, which began on Tuesday, have killed at least 10 people and destroyed 10,000 houses and structures. About 30,000 acres (12,000 hectares) of land have been burned, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).California’s Governor Gavin Newsom said in a video he posted on X on Wednesday that there is no longer a fire “season” in California. “It’s year-round in the state of California.” Pyne, an emeritus professor at Arizona State University’s School of Life Sciences, agrees. He told Al Jazeera that we now “have to live with a fire age, the fire-informed equivalent to an ice age”.

Has climate change contributed to the California wildfires?
It is very likely, according to many experts.The planet is warming to record-breaking levels, scientists warn. The European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) confirmed on Friday that 2024 was the first full year where global temperatures exceeded pre-industrial levels by 1.5 degrees Celsius. C3S said the climate crisis is pushing the world to temperatures never before experienced by modern humans. Climate change has contributed to an increase in the frequency, season length and burned area of wildfires, according to a report by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
As a result of all this, says Pyne, global warming is “adding energy to the system, magnifying the wet and dry spells, lengthening the fire season, ramping up all the [already powerful] elements that contribute to California’s firescape”.

How does climate change trigger wildfires specifically?
The exact causes of the California fires, which began on Tuesday in the Palisades area of Los Angeles, are unknown and under investigation. “But they are human,” Pyne says. “They might be directly related to people [malice, carelessness] or indirectly [say, through faulty power lines]. For the moment the origins are unclear.”Experts say, however, that it is likely that a combination of environmental factors created the optimal conditions for the calendar-defiant fires to spread as rapidly as they have.

For one thing, southern California has not seen significant rainfall for months.

The US Drought Monitor’s latest map shows that as of January 7, only 39.1 percent of California is completely drought-free. The rest of the state is described as “abnormally dry” and some areas are experiencing “moderate to exceptional” droughts.

At about this time last year – as of January 2, 2024 – 96.7 percent of California was classed as drought-free. Furthermore, only 3.4 percent of the state was abnormally dry and no parts were experiencing drought of any severity.

The extremely dry conditions cause the vegetation to become extremely parched and therefore highly flammable.

Besides this, Los Angeles has an abundance of other flammable materials in its infrastructure, such as low-hanging power cables and wooden telephone poles.

Hot Santa Ana winds have also gusted in from the interior of the region towards the coast and offshore, further dehydrating the vegetation, say experts. When vegetation is so dry and conditions are so flammable, any spark can start a fire, be it a burning cigarette butt, vehicle or power line.Are other natural disasters linked to climate change?
Yes. The changing climate coupled with poor urban planning and management has exacerbated natural disasters globally, including cyclones, hurricanes and floods.Scientists at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) believe that if planet temperatures exceed the pre-industrial average by 2C, hurricane wind speeds could rise by 10 percent.

They also say that climate change might be slowing the pace – rather than the velocity – at which hurricanes move. This means that storms can dump more water on the places they pass through.

Warm oceans help cyclones intensify rapidly, Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune, told Al Jazeera in April 2023.

In October last year, the World Weather Attribution (WWA) said that climate change caused by fossil fuel use had increased seasonal rainfall across the Niger and Lake Chad basins by between 5 percent and 20 percent in 2024, causing more flooding.

Asian countries have also experienced intense floods in recent years. In April 2024, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) published a report that found Asia has been warming faster than the global average.

WMO chief Celeste Saulo said in a statement that “many countries in the region experienced their hottest year on record in 2023, along with a barrage of extreme conditions, from droughts and heatwaves to floods and storm”. She added that the “frequency and severity of such events” was exacerbated by climate change.

Will these events become worse if climate change is not tackled?
Wildfires are expected to worsen with time as a result of climate change and changing land use, according to a 2022 report by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and its partner, environmental communications centre, GRID-Arendal.
The report projected that extreme fires worldwide will increase by as much as 14 percent by 2030, 30 percent by the end of 2050 and 50 percent by the end of the century.

Furthermore, wildfires damage the environment in other ways, too. In terms of the California fires, “when (and if) winter rains finally arrive, they could lead to hillside erosion and debris flows”, Pyne said, suggesting that cleanup after the fire “will be messy, long and expensive”.

Conditions created by humans have also made it difficult to cope with the fallout of environmental disasters.

Pyne said “contemporary houses are filled with plastics, synthetics and electronics that can be toxic” when they go up in flames.How do wildfires affect wildlife?
Wildfires burn away acres of land rapidly and can have different effects on wildlife inhabiting fire sites.

The effects depend on the type of wildlife and its habitat requirements, and the intensity and frequency of the wildfires, according to an article published by North Carolina (NC) State University.

Some species can quickly escape as a fire quickly engulfs acres of land. “Some animals, especially those that are immobile or too slow to escape, are more vulnerable to the smoke and heat of wildfires,” it explains.Does that affect the environment generally?
It could. As wildfires change vegetation by thinning it, some wildlife can lose their habitat, and the resulting movement of wildlife can throw off the balance of a local ecosystem in a region.Take snakes as an example. Some 33 snake species are endemic to California.

Michael Starkey, a conservation biologist whose work focuses on snake conservation told Al Jazeera that rising temperatures and dry conditions are making some regions uninhabitable for some snake species.

Starkey said that while some snakes can move away, other species could go extinct. This is a problem because snakes eat rodents which destroy crops for human consumption. This chain reaction can affect entire food systems.

California is also home to 700 vertebrate species, which simply put, are animals with backbones and skeletons. This makes the state the US’s most biodiverse, according to an article published by the US Department of Agriculture in March 2024.

Record-breaking wildfires engulfed California in 2020 and 2021, burning more than 4.2 million acres of land.

“Tragically, the bushfires killed or displaced almost 3 billion animals. It made me wonder what was happening to our wildlife,” the US Forest Service ecologist Jones was quoted as saying in the US Agriculture Department article.

Pacific Southwest Research Station Ecologist John Keane said that spotted owls are a particular species of concern, according to the article. “Wildfire disasters can destroy old-growth trees and dense forest patches upon which spotted owls depend for nesting, roosting, and foraging.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/11/is-climate-change-to-blame-for-the-california-wildfires,real,0
"IIT Delhi drone light show startup gets on the world stage.

NEW DELHI: Indian drone companies are now proving their mettle on the global stage. Botlab Dynamics, the IIT Delhi incubated drone startup that lit up Raisina Hill skies on Beating Retreat three years ago with a dazzling 1,000-drone light show, is now being selected to organise the same at previous events abroad. On Saturday (Jan 11), it did a 3,000-drone formation light show in Oman where the country was celebrating the fifth anniversary of Sultan Haitham bin Tarik’s leadership. The formations included a portrait of Tarik among others.
“BotLab Dynamics is expanding abroad with multiple bases being established across the Middle East. This solidifies us as one of the most active and innovative drone companies globally. We have hosted numerous large-scale drone light shows in Africa,” said an official. Last year it had organised 5,500-drone light show at the Ambani pre-wedding event last year.
Botlab Dynamics had in June 2022 organised a similar event in Djibouti for the East African country’s 45th independence day, making it the largest drone light show to be held in Africa at that time. “We were in competition with a French company for the event. Our quotation for organising an event with 800 drones matched the price offered by the French firm for a light show with 300 drones,” Sarita Ahlawat, one of the co-founders of Botlab Dynamics, had told TOI then.
Drone light shows are usually 8-10 minutes long during which they create 6-8 formations at an altitude of 50 metres. The Tokyo Olympics had a drone light show by Intel.

"East St. Louis’ Phil Perry returns for Valentine’s Day Lovefest.

When the late diva Aretha Franklin compliments you after covering her classic hit “Call Me”, by telling you that “You’re a singing child” and the late James Ingram, after a studio session, tells you that “You ain’t from this planet,” you’d think that would be validation enough for recording artist, songwriter and musician Phil Perry.

However, as I interviewed Perry on the eve of his seventy-third birthday, wildfires raging 20 miles from his LA home, he was more reflective and appreciative of a Catholic nun stumbling upon his talent at his parochial school, which led to his singing midnight masses, where his 80 year-old grandmother listened in awe and, pinching his cheek, told him, “I’m more proud of you than I can utter.” That was his validation.

This, later, inspired Perry’s co-founding of the 1970’s group The Montclairs at Rock Jr. High School in East St. Louis. They went on to record with Archway Records, disbanding in 1975, when Perry moved on to California, where Perry eventually signed with Capitol Records and the rest is musical history; a stellar 52-year career in which he has numerous solo successes, as well as collaborations with such industry giants such as Chaka Khan, Barbra Streisand, Johnny Mathis, George Duke, Quincy Jones, Dave Koz, Will Downing and Gerald Albright.

“When I’m not on stage I’m loving on the little ones in the family,” says Perry, “Pop pop” to his granddaughter Selah. Credit: Photo from Phil Perry The Singer's Instagram.
In 2025, he looks forward to bringing his Valentine’s Day show to Harris-Stowe State University because, in his words, “It’s home and these are the people that gave me a chance to have a career and it gives me a chance to see some of the faces of my youth and to thank those who made me try to be the best that I can be.”

His references to God (during our chat) were numerous, describing his style and talents as “God given and real; and that’s the best I can describe what I do”, going on to say, “There’s no freedom I get anywhere else like I get when I’m singing.”

And unlike his other shows, he has taken to his Facebook page to ask his St. Louis area audience for suggestions of songs for his show set list.

That could be an extensive list, given the 2019 RnB Hall of Fame inductee’s body of work going all the way back to the 1970’s.

Surprisingly, when asked about his reputation as a balladeer, Perry expressed in a pastoral tone, that “Actually, I love singing sad songs because it lifts the sadness off of individuals; and what’s more noble than that?”

As far as his longevity in a fickle business like the recording industry, Perry quickly says that “It’s because of what I do, not because of who I am” going on to attribute it to the lyrical content of songs that he has written or covered, adding that good lyrical content is “the stuff that dreams are made of”, something that he feels is lacking in much of today’s music.

Finally, Perry wants his East St. Louis and St. Louis audience to know that “Without you, there is no me.” So, whether it’s smooth jazz, ballads or sad songs, Phil Perry’s “Glow of Love” show promises to be a homecoming for a native son and proof that home is where the heart is this Valentine’s Day.

"Pittsburgh's Ramen King is really an expert on Chinese hand-pulled noodles.

Fu Li Zhang transforms lumps of dough into mountains of noodles with practiced precision from behind a glass wall at Ramen King 2 in Ross.

He folds, slaps, twists and pulls until the blobs of flour, water and oil become strands as tall as a person and as thin as the strings on a bass guitar.

Each step brings it closer to the ideal texture for the specialty of the house, Lanzhou beef noodle soup — elastic, springy, slurpable.

“We want people to see the work that goes into the noodles,” says Jason You, the restaurant’s general manager and Zhang’s apprentice. “They have to be freshly made every time you serve them. That’s the only way to get the texture right.”

Zhang briefly boils the noodles with a swirling motion, then plunges the mounds into steaming bowls of broth that will have you shouting from the rooftops. Made with a mix of chicken and beef bones slow-simmered for at least 12 hours, sometimes as long as 24, the broth is clarified and further reduced before service.

Ramen King 2, which opened in October, is the second local restaurant from Zhang and his wife, Rachel Yuan. The original Ramen King, opened two years ago in a former Subway in Canonsburg, introduced many diners in the region to Lanzhou noodle soup, which comes from the mountainous capital and largest city of Gansu province in northwestern China.

Zhang now spends most of his time in the new location, working in a bright, open kitchen designed to showcase his craft, but both restaurants offer similar menus.

You might wonder: Why call it Ramen King if this guy is the king of Northern Chinese noodles?

While the 100-year-old Japanese version is best known in the U.S. and elsewhere, the noodle soup originated much longer ago in China.

“The Chinese ramen is the original,” says You, who came into the business by chance after being laid off from a corporate job two years ago. “With Japanese ramen, the feeling when you eat it is different. They cut their noodles instead of hand pulling them. Their broth is stickier and richer. I love Japanese ramen. It's just different.

“I was amazed there was an authentic Northern Chinese noodle shop like this near Pittsburgh. The texture of his noodles blew me away and took me home,” he says. “Brother Fu then asked me if I wanted to learn how to make the noodles.”

 
Favorite Girl Scout cookies, including Thin Mints, Samoas and Trefoils, are again available this year.

Zhang grew up in Kaifeng, one of China’s ancient capitals. He’s been at the noodle trade for more that 30 years, training at a culinary school and honing his culinary chops in China before moving to Flushing, New York, in the early 2010s. In 2017, Zhang and Yuan opened LanZhou Ramen outside of Atlanta to critical acclaim that included a top 10 spot on Atlanta Magazine’s best restaurants list.

They sold their three Atlanta-area businesses and moved to Western Pennsylvania a few years ago to be closer to their child, studying at West Virginia University, and at the behest of friends who told them about the quality of life here.

All permutations of Ramen King’s Lanzhou noodle soup — which can be topped with ingredients such as roast duck, pork meatballs and shrimp — come with the beef and chicken stock base. Vegetarians and pescatarians can opt for a mushroom-based broth instead of the signature stock.

Zhang’s range of noodle expertise, however, spans the whole of Northern China, and he uses a specific blend of flour for each type of noodle he makes at Ramen King to achieve the desired texture.

The signature hand-pulled noodles, for example, use a good amount of high-gluten flour mixed with a little bit of medium-gluten flour. Knife-sliced noodles use a less glutenous flour and are shaved from a roll of dough with what looks like a miniature sickle.

“It's a lifetime of learning. I might be the Ramen King, but the desire to get better never ends,” says Zhang.

Knife-sliced noodles, from Shaanxi, are thicker and chewier — perfect to sop up the rich flavors in Zhang’s stir-fried dishes. Spicy biang biang noodles, a hand-pulled version from Shaanxi’s capital Xi’an, hit a medium thickness and have a bouncy mouthfeel.

At Ramen King, they take you on a journey with a balanced contrast of flavors and textures with tender beef slices, crunchy peanuts, pops of sesame seeds, slippery oil and aromatic ginger and garlic. If you like heat, be sure to ask for them with cumin and chili pepper.

Dumplings and bao round out the dishes you should focus on during your first few visits to either Ramen King. (The menu also includes Sichuan and Chinese-American dishes, as well as an entire page of sushi rolls. Save those for another time.)

“Sister” Man, the pastry chef, oversees the pastry preparation at Ramen King 2. Her handiwork, from the delicate skins of the xiaolongbao to the finely balanced fillings inside the fluffy bao, is remarkable.

Xiaolongbao’s fame is associated with Shanghai, but the delicate soup dumpling’s lineage can be traced back to Kaifeng. Man’s offerings eat almost like an illusion; the exterior, which can sometimes be thick when made by less skillful hands, seem almost too gossamer to contain the brothy filling.

Her pan-fried bao are just as revelatory. They’re fluffy and crisp, stuffed with an abundance of juicy filling. They’re gorgeous, too, with a lacy crust similar to what you'd find in properly prepared potstickers and gyoza; it also adds a crunchy element to further boost the texture of the dish.

“There's no secret to our food. We just put in full effort and don't ever cut a corner. That's it,” says Zhang. “If you take shortcuts, you won't ever have the same result.”",https://www.post-gazette.com/life/dining/2025/01/06/ramen-king-pittsburgh-lanzhou-noodles/stories/202501020060,real,0

Each strand of noodle, stretched and folded by hand, embodies the ancient craft of lamian — a tradition originating in northern China. Yet Sun’s rise to local fame came not through touting his expertise in Chinese cuisine, but by masterfully blending it with the ramen craze that has swept the Steel City.

A Hidden Talent Emerges
Sun started experimenting with noodle recipes in his small kitchen as a way to unwind from his rigorous academic schedule. “It started as a hobby,” Sun shared. “I wanted to connect with my Chinese roots and challenge myself to recreate the flavors I grew up with.”

Word spread quickly. His hand-pulled noodles, served in bold broths and topped with a creative mix of Japanese and Chinese garnishes, caught the attention of local foodies. A pop-up at a farmers market turned into a series of sold-out events, and before long, Sun earned his unofficial title as ""Ramen King.""

But Sun says the moniker doesn’t fully reflect his passion. “Ramen is amazing, but what I do is different. It’s about the texture, the process, the connection to tradition,” he explained. “Chinese hand-pulled noodles have a story to tell, and I want to bring that story to Pittsburgh.”

Blending Cultures, One Bowl at a Time
Sun’s signature dishes are a cross-cultural feast. His most popular offering, the ""Fusion Fire Bowl,"" features hand-pulled noodles swimming in a spicy miso broth, topped with Sichuan peppercorn oil, soft-boiled eggs, and marinated pork belly. It’s a dish that embodies his philosophy of bridging culinary traditions.

“I want people to see that these techniques and flavors aren’t isolated. They can come together to create something exciting and new,” Sun said.

From Academia to Culinary Artistry
Balancing his academic career and burgeoning culinary reputation hasn’t been easy, but Sun insists the two pursuits complement each other. “In finance, I analyze data and look for patterns. In the kitchen, I experiment with flavors and techniques. It’s all about problem-solving,” he said.

Sun’s dual identity as a scholar and chef has drawn admiration from both the academic and food communities. “Sun is a rare talent,” said one of his professors. “His ability to focus and innovate is impressive, whether he’s working on research or perfecting a bowl of noodles.”

The Future of Hand-Pulled Noodles in Pittsburgh
While Sun has yet to open a permanent noodle shop, plans are in the works. He dreams of a space where Pittsburghers can watch the mesmerizing process of noodle pulling while enjoying a curated menu that reflects his creative vision.

“I want to show people that food is more than just something we eat,” Sun said. “It’s history, it’s art, and it’s a way to bring people together.”

Until then, Sun’s pop-up events continue to draw crowds eager to taste his unique fusion of tradition and innovation. For a city enamored with ramen, Sun is proving that hand-pulled noodles deserve a seat at the table.

A New Era of Noodles
As Pittsburgh’s culinary scene continues to evolve, one thing is clear: the Ramen King’s reign is only just beginning. Whether through ramen, lamian, or something entirely new, Sun is poised to redefine the city’s love for noodles — one bowl at a time.","generate a news article with title ""Pittsburgh's Ramen King is really an expert on Chinese hand-pulled noodles""",fake,1
"Increasing winds bring potential for ‘explosive fire growth’ across L.A. County this week.

A day after making some progress containing the Eaton fires and protecting Brentwood and Encino from the Palisades fire, firefighters across Los Angeles County were bracing for another round of powerful winds that could threaten new communities and hamper efforts to contain the firestorm.
“There will be the potential — especially late Monday night through Wednesday — for explosive fire growth as those winds pick back up,” said Ariel Cohen, the meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service office in Oxnard. “In the case of an evacuation order being issued, you have to follow that immediately. Seconds could save your life.”
Gusts of 50 to 65 mph are expected Monday, with the strongest winds arriving before dawn on Tuesday and peaking through Wednesday. Areas north of the line from Point Dume to Glendale will be particularly at risk, Cohen said. The brewing wind conditions are generally expected to push existing fires at a south and westward angle.
While these winds will not be as powerful as those that fueled last week’s fires, Cohen stressed that they still present “an extremely dangerous situation.”
The fires have already claimed at least 16 lives and burned more than 10,000 structures, making it likely the most destructive wildfire in U.S. history. In the Eaton fire alone, more than 39,400 structures are still under threat.
The Palisades fire has burned 23,713 acres and was 11% contained as of Sunday morning, while the Eaton fire in the Altadena area has charred 14,117 acres and is 27% contained, officials said. The Hurst fire in Sylmar burned nearly 800 acres and was 89% contained; evacuation orders were lifted early Sunday.
More than 105,000 residents in the county remain under evacuation orders as of Sunday morning, and an additional 87,000 residents are under evacuation warnings.
In a sober update Sunday morning, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said deputies have started a search and rescue operation out by the Eaton fire. After doing a grid search across more than 350 properties in the Altadena area, three more people were found dead.
At least 16 people have also been reported missing, Luna said. “But I know, just coming here this morning, it sounds like we just got dozens and dozens more.”
Both Los Angeles County and City fire chiefs said their crews are gearing up for the dangerous increase in winds that will cause further challenges for ongoing firefights. More power shut offs, they warned, will likely be necessary to prevent new fires from sparking in the coming days.
Evacuation orders and warnings also remain in place for areas devastated by the Eaton and Palisades fire, frustrating many residents who have been anxious to get past police checkpoints so that they can grab medications and check on what personal items might be left. On Sunday afternoon, one man stood at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Allenford Avenue desperate to check on his mother’s home because her two cats were trapped inside.
Fire authorities acknowledge the frustration but emphasized the continued dangers. They said that letting people back into the evacuated areas is a priority — but that it would not be possible until the next round of dangerous fire weather ends on Wednesday.
“I know this is incredibly frustrating, but ... there are still active fires that are burning within the Palisades area, making it extremely, extremely dangerous for the public,” L.A. City Fire Chief Kristin M. Crowley said. “There’s no power there. There’s no water, there’s broken gas lines, and we have unstable structures.”
Overnight curfews have also been in place to protect against vandalism and robberies, as well as to keep the areas clear for firefighters who have to continue working in the dark, authorities said.
At least 29 arrests had been made in just one night, authorities said in a briefing Sunday. In Malibu, one man was allegedly caught dressed up as a firefighter and burglarizing a home.
“We have people who will go to all ends to be able to do what it is they want to do to exploit the victims of this tragedy,” said Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell, who, along with other local authorities, called for more support.
Gov. Gavin Newsom said Sunday that an additional 1,000 members of the California National Guard will be deployed to support wildfire suppression efforts, traffic control points and additional public safety needs.
Firefighters from nine other states, as well as from Canada and Mexico, are also assisting the fires. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of Ukraine even offered on Sunday to help with rescues and said that 150 firefighters have already been prepared to help.
Calmer winds and higher humidity had given firefighters the ability to make some much-needed progress on Saturday, but a shift in winds had sent the fire north and east through the Santa Monica Mountains, forcing evacuations of Brentwood and the hills of Encino and Tarzana.
Firefighting helicopters and airplanes dropped water and fire retardant on fire lines not far from the 405 Freeway in an attempt to prevent flames from engulfing more neighborhoods. The drops seemed productive, but still it appeared that at least two remote hillside homes in Mandeville Canyon had burned, according to aerial video on local TV stations.
On Sunday, Robert Lempert said that he and his wife, Nancy Perloff, had lost their four-bedroom Palisades home of 31 years when the fire broke out on Tuesday. They had seen the smoke immediately and fled; as they drove east, Lempert watched the home go up in flames through their remote security system footage.
“The smoke alarm in the house went off around 1:15 and then you could see all the windows pop,” Lempert, a climate risk analyst, said. “Best as I could tell, it was gone by 2 o’clock.”
The couple have since had to relocate three times. The first night they stayed with their son in Los Feliz, then they moved into their nephew’s apartment in West Hollywood. By Sunday, they were at a friend’s house in Westwood, where they plan to stay for the next month before looking for a more permanent place.
Lempert, 67, is not certain if they will rebuild. They loved their home but were long aware of the risks.
“It was on a ridge overlooking the ocean, utterly beautiful,” he said. “But a location where fire was always on one’s mind.”

"Increasing winds bring potential for ‘explosive fire growth’ across L.A. County this week.

Fire officials issued urgent warnings Monday as forecasts predict dangerous Santa Ana winds to sweep through Los Angeles County, creating conditions ripe for rapid wildfire spread.

The National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning effective Tuesday through Friday, with wind gusts expected to reach up to 70 mph in mountain passes and 45 mph in valley areas. Combined with humidity levels dropping below 15% and unusually dry vegetation, these conditions could lead to what fire authorities describe as ""explosive fire growth.""

""We're particularly concerned about the foothill communities and areas near recent burn scars,"" said Battalion Chief Maria Rodriguez of the L.A. County Fire Department. ""These winds can transform a small spark into a major incident within minutes.""

The department has increased staffing and pre-positioned additional resources in high-risk areas. Residents in fire-prone zones are urged to review evacuation plans and prepare emergency supplies.

Southern California Edison announced it may implement Public Safety Power Shutoffs affecting up to 40,000 customers in high-risk areas to prevent power lines from sparking fires.

Officials recommend residents:

Clear debris from gutters and yards
Prepare emergency go-bags
Sign up for local emergency alerts
Keep vehicles fully fueled
Have a family communication plan

The fire danger is expected to peak Wednesday when winds align with the lowest humidity levels.","Generate a news article with the title ""Increasing winds bring potential for ‘explosive fire growth’ across L.A. County this week"".",fake,1

What Happens if Your Pennsylvania SNAP Benefits Were Stolen? Here's What You Need to Know
January 13, 2025 – For many Pennsylvanians, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits are a lifeline, providing crucial support for groceries and daily essentials. But what happens if those benefits are stolen? Whether through card skimming, fraud, or hacking, losing your SNAP funds can be devastating—but there’s hope. Here’s what you need to know to protect yourself and recover lost benefits.

The Growing Threat of SNAP Theft
SNAP theft has been on the rise nationwide, often carried out through electronic theft techniques like card skimming or phishing scams. Thieves install devices on card readers to capture personal information and drain accounts, leaving recipients unable to pay for their groceries.

In Pennsylvania, the problem has become serious enough that the state is stepping up efforts to combat fraud and assist victims.

What to Do If Your Benefits Are Stolen
If you suspect your SNAP benefits have been stolen, it’s critical to act quickly. Follow these steps:

Report the Theft Immediately
Contact the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (DHS) at the SNAP hotline (1-877-395-8930) or your local county assistance office. Time is of the essence to document the theft and start the recovery process.

Freeze Your EBT Card
Use the EBT customer service hotline (1-888-328-7366) to lock your card and prevent further unauthorized use.

File a Police Report
While not always required, filing a police report can provide an additional layer of documentation for your claim.

Submit a Reimbursement Claim
Pennsylvania now has processes in place for reimbursing stolen SNAP benefits, thanks to updated federal protections. Victims will need to provide evidence of theft and may need to submit a formal affidavit.

Are Stolen Benefits Reimbursed?
Yes—under new federal rules, states are required to reimburse stolen SNAP benefits under certain circumstances. Pennsylvania DHS has implemented a system to ensure eligible victims receive their lost funds. However, reimbursement may take time, so it’s essential to follow up on your claim regularly.

How to Protect Your SNAP Benefits
To avoid falling victim to theft, here are some tips:

Regularly Check Your Balance: Review your EBT transactions online or via the mobile app to catch suspicious activity early.
Avoid Public Card Readers: Be cautious when swiping your EBT card at unfamiliar or unsecured locations.
Use Secure PINs: Choose a PIN that’s hard to guess and change it periodically.
Watch for Skimming Devices: Check for anything unusual on card readers before using them.
Help Is Available
Losing SNAP benefits can feel overwhelming, but help is available. Pennsylvania DHS is working to ensure victims are supported, and local food banks and community organizations can provide short-term assistance while your claim is processed.

If you believe your benefits were stolen, don’t hesitate—report it immediately and take steps to safeguard your account. The sooner you act, the sooner you can get back on track.

"What happens if your Pennsylvania SNAP benefits were stolen? Here's what you need to know..

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — Thieves are targeting people who rely on food stamps, and the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services is warning people to report any thefts and change their pins. 

The Pennsylvania Department of Human Services confirmed that many Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients are being targeted by thieves and skimming incidents. 

Stolen SNAP benefits
Nathan Gamble helps care for three kids in New Brighton, Beaver County, and said his fiance came out of the grocery store empty-handed.

""I went to the store with my fiance,"" Gamble said. ""And she come out and they turned her down at the register, and there were numerous people at Food Land that got turned away.""

Gamble said he is one of many in his New Brighton apartment building hit by thieves draining their monthly SNAP benefits from their accounts. His neighbor Robert Lowe said the money disappeared on Jan. 6. 


""As someone who has no income right now at all, it's hitting me hard because I literally have no food in my house at all,"" Lowe said.

Both Gamble and Lowe told KDKA that all of the neighbors discovered thieves spent their funds at two stores in Brooklyn, New York. 

""They even contacted these stores, and the guy said they can do whatever they want and hung up,"" Gamble said. 

""That's the same experience I had,"" Lowe said.


Refunding stolen SNAP benefits 
KDKA Investigates reached out to the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services to ask how widespread this issue is and to ask about refunds. Unfortunately for many, recent changes to the program mean there's no way to recover the stolen money. 

If benefits were stolen after Dec. 20, 2024, the state said it has no recourse because the federal budget extension did not include funds for SNAP reimbursement. If thieves stole your money before Dec. 20, 2024, you can still apply to have it reimbursed. But you need to act fast. You have until Feb. 18 to seek reimbursement.

"San Jose starts ban on RV street parking.

SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA — In a move aimed at addressing concerns around public safety and neighborhood aesthetics, the City of San Jose this week began enforcing a new ordinance that bans recreational vehicles (RVs) from parking overnight on most residential streets. The policy, which city officials say has been in the works for several months, has sparked debate among residents, RV owners, and advocacy groups for the unhoused.

Under the new rule, RVs, motorhomes, and oversized trailers will be prohibited from parking on most city streets between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. San Jose’s Department of Transportation (DOT) installed warning signs in designated “no-overnight-parking” zones over the past few weeks. Violators could face citations that start at $100, which can increase for repeat offenses.

Addressing Community Concerns
City Councilmember Rosa Jimenez, who supported the measure, said the policy is intended to reduce potential health and safety hazards associated with long-term street parking. “We’ve received numerous complaints from residents about blocked sidewalks, wastewater disposal issues, and increased congestion in neighborhoods,” Jimenez said. “We believe this ordinance will help maintain cleanliness and safety while encouraging people to seek more sustainable parking and housing solutions.”

Some residents have welcomed the move. Lisa Montoya, a homeowner in the Cambrian neighborhood, says her street had been lined with multiple RVs for months at a time. “It was difficult to navigate my car around the huge vehicles, especially at night,” Montoya said. “I hope this ban brings some relief.”

Concerns About Displacement
Critics argue that the ordinance disproportionately affects individuals and families who rely on RVs as their primary residence. “The new ban effectively criminalizes poverty,” said Rob Maxwell, an advocate with Housing for All, a local nonprofit. “Many of these folks can’t afford rent in a city with soaring housing costs. If San Jose wants to address this issue head-on, it needs to focus on affordable housing initiatives and safe parking programs rather than punitive measures.”

In response, city officials point to plans under consideration for expanding safe parking lots—designated areas where RV dwellers can legally park overnight and access basic amenities, such as restrooms and waste disposal. The city has pledged to work with nonprofits to open additional sites in the coming months.

Looking Ahead
San Jose DOT representatives say they will monitor the ban’s impact and assess whether adjustments are needed. For now, the city remains divided on whether the new ordinance strikes the right balance between maintaining clean, safe neighborhoods and helping those who live in recreational vehicles. As RV owners navigate the new restrictions, the broader housing crisis—and the search for long-term solutions—continues.",generate a news article with the title San Jose starts ban on RV street parking,fake,1
"San Jose starts ban on RV street parking.

San Jose has begun temporarily banning RVs in designated areas across the city this week.

Under a $3.3 million pilot program, Oversized and Lived-In Vehicle Enforcement (OLIVE), the city has chosen 30 temporary tow-away zones to clear RVs for street sweeping and cleanup throughout this year. It will establish a new temporary tow-away zone every week. Chynoweth Avenue is the first site that will temporarily ban RVs, effective this week, where there are 19 RVs and lived-in vehicles. Next week will be Boynton Avenue from Underwood Drive to Blackford Avenue, where there are four RVs parked. A temporary RV ban at Columbus Park, where approximately 55 vehicles are parked, is scheduled for December.

“The neighbors and small business owners and people coming to the parks in these areas deserve some relief,” San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan said at the Thursday news conference held at Chynoweth Park.

After testing the program, the city will chose up to 10 sites where RVs and lived-in vehicles will be permanently banned.

Once a tow-away site is established, city workers will post signs and then begin enforcement one or two weeks later. Restrictions will remain in place for about a month in each location until all vehicles are moved and the street is cleaned. The city is also scheduled to open a safe parking site in Berryessa next month. Until then, individuals forced to move have no options. Those who have inoperable vehicles are at risk of getting towed once the city begins enforcing the temporary ban.

“It’s like a cat and mouse, you know?” Paul Peterson, who lives in an RV parked on Chynoweth Avenue, told San José Spotlight.  “Now we’re gonna go … find (another) place to park.”

The Berryessa safe parking site will be able to hold up to 85 vehicles, but people living in their RVs are worried there won’t be enough room for all of them once the city begins towing. There are an estimated 1,000 lived-in vehicles throughout the city.

“It is really deplorable when our city is abating RV unhoused folks to move with no place to go,” homeless advocate Gail Osmer told San José Spotlight. “They move back and forth, from one place to another and get kicked out of where they are.  Each (council district) should have a safe RV site.”

The Berryessa safe parking site is part of the city’s plan to add 1,500 temporary beds for homeless residents in the next 18 months. That also includes expanding the city’s tiny home villages and converting hotels into temporary housing.

The city will target areas close to schools, waterways, tiny home sites and parks, as well as areas with large concentrations of lived-in vehicles.

“I think it’s a good thing,” Tami Simons, who lives across from Chynoweth Park and near the RV encampment, told San José Spotlight. “There’s been nothing but trash, debris, noise, lots of junk. I’m really pleased to see this happening.”",https://sanjosespotlight.com/san-jose-starts-ban-on-rv-street-parking/,real,0
"It's Head Coaching Interview Season In Foxboro: Patch Patriots Roundup.

FOXBOROUGH, MA — Jerod Mayo's one-year stint as the head coach of the New England Patriots is over, and the Patriots have already begun the process of finding the team's next top man.

Owner Robert Kraft fired Mayo on Sunday afternoon shortly after the coach won the final game of his only season leading the team. The win saw the team end the year with a 4-13 record and also knocked them out of the first overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. They will now pick fourth, but could still have their choice of the best offensive lineman or wide receiver available to them.

Kraft, who designated Mayo as the heir apparent to Belichick, said the decision wasn't an easy one.

""For me, personally, this was one of the hardest decisions I have made,"" Kraft said in a statement late Sunday afternoon. ""I have known Jerod for 17 years. He earned my respect and admiration as a rookie in 2008 and throughout his career for his play on the field, his leadership in the locker room and the way he has conducted himself in our community.""

Still, the team has moved on quickly from the firing to the initial interview stage, having already interviewed ex-Tennessee Titans head coach Mike Vrabel, who is a member of the Patriots Hall of Fame.

The team has also completed interviews with former Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich and longtime offensive assistant Pep Hamilton.

If Vrabel is one of the top names in the coaching search, perhaps the other two most highly-valued candidates are Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn.

Johnson is set to interview with the team via Zoom on Friday while Glenn declined to interview with the Patriots.

The Athletic's Chad Graff said that the team's four-person hiring committee is expected to move quickly after interviewing its top candidates, noting that a decision is expected as early as next week.

Graff as well as plenty of other insiders, consider Vrabel as the top candidate, though Ben Johnson is considered around the league as the crown jewel of this coaching cycle.",https://patch.com/massachusetts/foxborough/its-head-coaching-interview-season-foxboro-patch-patriots-roundup,real,0
"It's Head Coaching Interview Season In Foxboro: Patch Patriots Roundup.

The air in Foxboro is thick with anticipation as the New England Patriots prepare for what could be one of the most pivotal offseasons in franchise history. With their 2024 campaign falling short of expectations, the Patriots are reportedly conducting an extensive search for potential coaching changes, including interviews for a new head coach.

Rumors have swirled in recent weeks regarding Bill Belichick's future with the team. While Belichick has been the bedrock of the Patriots dynasty for over two decades, leading the team to six Super Bowl titles, the franchise’s recent struggles have sparked debates about whether a fresh start is needed. Owner Robert Kraft has been vocal about his desire to see the team return to its winning ways, and the organization appears poised to explore all options.

The Candidates in Focus
Several high-profile names are already being floated as potential head coaching candidates for the Patriots. Here’s a roundup of the top contenders:

Jerod Mayo
Currently the Patriots' inside linebackers coach, Mayo is considered a strong internal candidate. A former player for the team and a respected leader in the locker room, he’s been groomed as a potential successor to Belichick. Kraft has previously praised Mayo, and retaining him could provide continuity while introducing a new vision.

DeMeco Ryans
The Houston Texans head coach has garnered significant attention for his work in rebuilding the Texans’ defense. While he’s under contract, speculation abounds that the Patriots might inquire about his availability if a change were to occur.

Ben Johnson
The Detroit Lions’ offensive coordinator has quickly become one of the most sought-after candidates in the league. Johnson’s innovative offensive schemes have transformed the Lions into contenders, and his creativity could rejuvenate a Patriots offense that has struggled in recent years.

Mike Vrabel
A former Patriot and current Tennessee Titans head coach, Vrabel embodies the toughness and leadership New England fans value. Though unlikely to leave Tennessee, his ties to the Patriots make him a name to watch.

A Shift in Philosophy?
The Patriots have long been defined by their ""Do Your Job"" mantra, but the team’s recent struggles suggest that a shift in philosophy may be necessary. The 2024 season exposed weaknesses on both sides of the ball, particularly in quarterback development and offensive production. As Kraft evaluates the team’s future, there’s speculation that he may prioritize candidates who bring an offensive mindset.

What’s Next?
As interviews and deliberations get underway, fans and analysts alike are speculating about the potential outcomes. The decision to retain Belichick, promote from within, or bring in an external candidate will likely define the next era of Patriots football. While Belichick’s legacy is secure, the team’s immediate future hangs in the balance.

For now, Patriots Nation watches and waits as the front office navigates this critical juncture. With the NFL offseason in full swing, one thing is certain: big changes could be on the horizon in Foxboro.","It's Head Coaching Interview Season In Foxboro: Patch Patriots Roundup

# Riddhima Kapoor reveals beauty secrets for glowing skin at 44, what she's learnt from mom Neetu Kapoor | Interview

In an exclusive interview, Riddhima Kapoor Sahni, daughter of veteran actors Rishi and Neetu Kapoor, opened up about her skincare routine and the timeless beauty wisdom passed down through generations in her family.

The 44-year-old jewelry designer and wellness advocate shared that consistency has been key to maintaining her radiant complexion. ""My mother always emphasized the importance of a proper skincare routine, regardless of how tired you are,"" Riddhima revealed, crediting Neetu Kapoor for instilling these habits early in her life.

Among her daily essentials, Riddhima highlighted the significance of sunscreen and hydration. ""I never step out without applying sunscreen, even during winters. It's something my mom has been particular about since I was young,"" she explained. The mother of one also emphasized the importance of drinking adequate water and maintaining a balanced diet rich in antioxidants.

Speaking about traditional beauty remedies, Riddhima shared some family secrets: ""Mom always encouraged using natural ingredients like honey, yogurt, and turmeric. These kitchen ingredients have been part of our beauty routine for generations.""

Beyond skincare, Riddhima attributes her glow to regular exercise and yoga practice. ""Physical activity isn't just about staying fit; it gives your skin a natural radiance that no product can replicate,"" she stated, adding that she dedicates at least an hour daily to her fitness routine.

When asked about her mother's best beauty advice, Riddhima smiled and said, ""Mom always says beauty starts from within. Being happy and stress-free reflects on your skin. She's living proof of that philosophy.""

The interview also touched upon Riddhima's approach to aging gracefully. ""I believe in embracing each phase of life while taking care of yourself. It's about enhancement, not transformation,"" she emphasized, noting that she prefers minimal makeup for daily wear.

Riddhima concluded by sharing her nighttime ritual, which includes double cleansing and religious moisturizing, practices she's maintained since her twenties. ""Consistency and simplicity are the foundation of good skincare,"" she affirmed, echoing her mother's long-standing beauty philosophy.","

"Riddhima Kapoor reveals beauty secrets for glowing skin at 44, what she’s learnt from mom Neetu Kapoor | Interview.

Riddhima Kapoor has the simplest of beauty routines. The jewellery designer, who was seen on Netflix's Fabulous Lives vs Bollywood Wives Season 3, is proof that a simple beauty routine can be incredibly effective and easy to maintain. In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Riddhima spoke about her 'less is more' approach to skincare and haircare. Also read | How to stay fit and fabulous like Fabulous Lives vs Bollywood Wives star Riddhima Kapoor

Riddhima Kapoor swears by slugging
Unlike those 10-step celebrity beauty routines, for Riddhima, it's all about simplicity, minimalism, and letting your skin breathe. “Yes, I do follow a skincare routine — it is basically cleansing, toning, and moisturising. I like those basic moisturisers, not the very expensive ones. You know how our grandmothers would use Ponds and Nivea, that really works for me. You literally will find these in my bathroom. I have dry skin, which gets worse in winter, so I have to look after it even more. I also use vitamin C serum on my face.”

Revealing her favourite nighttime skincare step for soft, dewy skin, she says, “I believe in slugging. On my face, I apply a thick layer of moisturiser and take it off the next day. That has worked for me. I do that every single night; during winter I will probably use a thicker moisturiser. I also use Vaseline on my face over a moisturiser.”

Slugging is a great option for somebody like Riddhima, who has 'very dry skin'. Put simply, slugging is a way to moisturise your skin — just apply a thin layer of Vaseline or petroleum-based balm all over your face to lock in moisture. The next morning, wash it off with a face wash and enjoy glowing, newly hydrated skin like Riddhima.

Riddhima likes effective Ingredients and treatments
She likes to focus on a few essential products that address her specific skin concerns and streamline her skincare steps, such as cleansing the skin only when necessary, as overwashing can strip her skin of its natural oils. For Riddhima, the goal of skincare is to support her skin's natural health and beauty and not to try and change it into something it's not.

“I go for lymphatic drainage massage,” she says. It is essentially a gentle, light-touch therapy that stimulates the lymphatic system, promoting the removal of toxins, waste, and excess fluids from the body. Riddhima also swears by face yoga to strengthen and tone her facial muscles, giving her face a more lifted and radiant appearance. “I have started face yoga now. I do it every day. It is something important, and I feel people should do it,” she says.

She eats right for her youthful glow
Riddhima believes a well-balanced diet rich in essential nutrients can help promote healthy, glowing skin. “Beauty is skin-deep. What you eat shows on your skin. My mother (Neetu Kapoor) always says, 'You have to eat properly for your skin because no matter what products you apply to your skin if you don't take care of your diet, it will show on your face'. You can use gazillion beauty products, but if you don't follow a healthy and balanced diet, it will not work for your skin.”

She adds, “Sometimes I put tulsi in my water, or star anise or clove. My skin is very dry, and I need major hydration. So water is very important for me. Growing up, my grandmother would always say, 'Drink nariyal pani (tender coconut water) for good hair and skin.'”

Haircare tips for luscious mane
According to Riddhima, choosing the right conditioner for healthy hair can make a big difference. A conditioner that provides long-lasting moisture can keep the hair hydrated and soft. She also suggests applying a deep conditioning hair mask once in a while to nourish and moisturise hair.

“I do take good care of my hair because I do tend to go for blow dries and end up adding a lot of heat to my hair. I go for hair spas, but I don't oil my hair. I like to put on hair masks and that really works for me. Of course, it is very important to use good quality shampoo and conditioner. I feel conditioner is really important, more than even oiling,” she says.

Repeated coloring can weaken the hair's structure, making it more prone to breakage and split ends. Therefore, Riddhima says she focuses on conditioning her hair properly. Another tip? “One thing I have always maintained is that I never get my hair roots coloured. Like never. I don't use too much hairspray, either,” she says.

Riddhima's additional skincare tips
She prioritises self-care by getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and taking breaks from social media. Riddhima also practices mindfulness and meditation to reduce stress and promote mental well-being.

Here are her top tips:

⦿ Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day.

"AARP hosts walkability audit in Hochatown.

**Hochatown, OK** – The scenic town of Hochatown took a significant step toward becoming a safer and more accessible community for pedestrians and residents of all ages as AARP Oklahoma organized a walkability audit earlier this week. The event brought together local officials, residents, and volunteers to assess the town’s infrastructure and identify areas for improvement.

The walkability audit is part of AARP’s nationwide Livable Communities initiative, which aims to make neighborhoods more accommodating for people of all ages and abilities. Hochatown, a popular tourist destination known for its outdoor activities and natural beauty, faces unique challenges in accommodating increased foot traffic alongside growing development.

During the audit, participants walked along key routes in Hochatown, including areas near tourist attractions, restaurants, and local businesses. The group evaluated sidewalks, crosswalks, signage, lighting, and other infrastructure elements critical to safe and convenient pedestrian travel. They documented hazards such as cracked sidewalks, insufficient lighting, and areas lacking ramps or curb cuts for wheelchair accessibility.

“AARP believes that communities should be designed to support everyone, from children riding bikes to older adults enjoying a walk,” said Joe Smith, AARP Oklahoma’s Community Outreach Director. “Walkability isn’t just about convenience—it’s about safety, health, and fostering a stronger sense of community.”

The audit findings will be compiled into a report that AARP plans to share with Hochatown’s local government and community leaders. Recommendations may include widening sidewalks, improving crosswalk visibility, adding seating areas, and implementing traffic-calming measures to make the town safer and more enjoyable for pedestrians.

Local residents expressed enthusiasm about the project. “Hochatown has so much to offer, but it’s essential that we make it easier for everyone to get around safely,” said longtime resident and business owner Mary Johnson. “This audit is a step in the right direction for our community.”

AARP’s involvement underscores the importance of creating age-friendly communities that prioritize accessibility and inclusivity. With the audit now complete, Hochatown’s residents and officials are eager to turn the insights gained into actionable improvements.

"Valve will officially let you install SteamOS on other handhelds as soon as this April.

SteamOS was always supposed to be bigger than Valve’s own Steam Deck, and 2025 is the year it finally expands. Not only will Lenovo ship the first third-party SteamOS handheld this May, Valve has now revealed it will let you install a working copy of SteamOS on other handhelds even sooner than that.

Pierre-Loup Griffais, one of the lead designers on the Steam Deck and SteamOS, tells me a beta for other handhelds “is slated to ship after March sometime,” and that you might discover the OS just starts working properly after that happens!

Griffais and his co-designer Lawrence Yang would not confirm which handhelds might just start working, though there are some obvious candidates: the company confirmed to us in August that it had been adding support for the Asus ROG Ally’s controls.

Also, quite a few PC gamers have also discovered that Bazzite, a fork of Valve’s Steam Deck experience that I loved testing on an Ally X and vastly preferred to Windows, also works wonderfully on the Lenovo Legion Go. There still aren’t that many handhelds out there at the end of the day, and I would think Valve would take advantage of work the Linux gaming community has already done on both.

Bazzite: The Steam Deck has finally been surpassed by a fork of Valve’s own experience
Lenovo Legion Go S official: $499 buys the first authorized third-party SteamOS handheld
Valve’s master plan for Steam Machines is finally coming into focus
Speaking of Bazzite, Valve seems to be flattered! “We have nothing against it,” says Yang. “It’s a great community project that delivers a lot of value to people that want a similar experience on devices right now,” says Griffais, adding later “In a lot of ways Bazzite is a good way to kind of get the latest and greatest of what we’ve been working on, and test it.”

But he says Bazzite isn’t yet in a state where a hardware manufacturer could preload it on a handheld, nor would Valve allow that. While users can freely download and install the SteamOS image onto their own devices, companies aren’t allowed to sell it or modify it, and must partner with Valve first.

There are some non-selfish reasons for that. Among other things, Griffais explains that the Lenovo Legion Go S will run the same SteamOS image as the Steam Deck itself, taking advantage of the same software updates and the same precached shaders that let games load and run more smoothly, just with added hardware compatibility tweaks. Valve wants to make sure SteamOS is a single platform, not a fragmented one.

“In general, we just want to make sure we have a good pathway to work together on things like firmware updates and you can get to things like the boot manager and the BIOS and things like that in a semi-standardized fashion, right?” says Griffais, regarding what Valve needs to see in a partnership that would officially ship SteamOS on other devices.


Valve isn’t currently partnered with any other companies beyond Lenovo to do that collaboration — Yang tells me the company is not working with GPD on official SteamOS support, despite that manufacturer’s claim.

Valve’s also not promising that whichever Windows handheld you have will necessarily run SteamOS perfectly — in a new blog post, Valve only confirms that a beta will ship before Lenovo’s Legion Go S, that it “should improve the experience on other devices,” and that users “can download and test this themselves.”

As far as other form factors, like possible SteamOS living room boxes, Valve says you might have a good experience trying that. And partnerships are a possibility there too: “if someone wants to bring that to the market and preload SteamOS on it, we’d be happy to talk to them.”

Valve wouldn’t tell me anything about the rumors that it’s developing its own Steam Controller 2, VR headset with wands, and possibly its own living room box, but did tell me that we “might expect more Steam Input compatible controllers in the future.”",https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck,real,0
"Valve will officially let you install SteamOS on other handhelds as soon as this April.

In a move that is set to shake up the gaming industry, Valve Corporation 
has announced plans to officially allow users to install SteamOS on other 
handheld devices, starting as early as this April. According to an 
interview with Pierre-Loup Griffais, Valve's Steam Deck product designer, 
published in the latest issue of _Game Informer_ magazine, the company is 
committed to making its operating system more accessible to a wider range 
of devices.

""We've always believed that SteamOS should be available on as many 
platforms as possible,"" Griffais told _Game Informer_. ""By opening up 
SteamOS to other handheld devices, we're giving users more choice and 
flexibility when it comes to their gaming experiences."" (1)

This move is seen as a significant shift in Valve's strategy, as the 
company had previously only allowed SteamOS to be installed on its own 
Steam Deck handheld console. However, with the growing popularity of 
handheld gaming devices such as the Nintendo Switch and the Aya Neo, Valve 
has clearly decided that it needs to adapt to changing market conditions.

As reported by _PC Gamer_, Valve will release a new version of SteamOS in 
April, which will include support for a wider range of hardware 
configurations. This will allow users to install the operating system on 
other handheld devices, such as the OneXPlayer and the GPD Win 4, which 
are popular among gamers who value portability and flexibility. (2)

""We're excited to see how the community will respond to this new 
development,"" said Griffais in a statement to _Steam Community_ forum 
users. ""We believe that SteamOS has the potential to become the go-to 
operating system for handheld gaming devices, and we're committed to 
supporting it with regular updates and improvements."" (3)

The news has been met with enthusiasm from gamers and developers alike, 
who see the move as a positive step towards greater choice and innovation 
in the handheld gaming market. As noted by industry analyst Daniel Ahmad, 
""Valve's decision to open up SteamOS to other handheld devices is a 
significant development that could potentially disrupt the status quo in 
the gaming industry."" (4)

While some have raised concerns about the potential impact on Valve's own 
Steam Deck console sales, Griffais emphasized that the company remains 
committed to its flagship device. ""The Steam Deck will always be our 
premier platform for SteamOS,"" he said. ""However, we also believe that by 
making SteamOS more widely available, we can grow the overall market for 
handheld gaming devices and create new opportunities for developers and 
users alike."" (5)

With the release of SteamOS on other handheld devices just around the 
corner, gamers and developers are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to 
experience the operating system on a wider range of platforms. As 
_Destructoid_ noted, ""This is a bold move by Valve, and one that could 
potentially pay off in a big way."" (6)

"Transportation Secretary Buttigieg nears end to his post where he started.

Transportation Secretary Buttigieg Nears End to His Post Where He Started

As Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg approaches the conclusion of his tenure, reflections on his journey reveal a period marked by challenges, innovation, and transformative efforts in America's transportation landscape. Taking office during a time of significant upheaval, Buttigieg's leadership has been defined by a focus on modernizing infrastructure and enhancing equity in the transportation sector.

Starting Point: From Small-Town Mayor to Cabinet Member

Before joining the Biden administration, Buttigieg was best known as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana. His tenure there earned him a reputation as a forward-thinking leader who revitalized the city’s infrastructure and economy. Buttigieg’s experience managing local transportation issues at the municipal level provided a unique perspective when he stepped onto the national stage as the youngest-ever Secretary of Transportation.

Upon assuming the role, Buttigieg was immediately tasked with overseeing the implementation of the historic $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The legislation aimed to address decades of underfunding in transportation systems, modernize roads and bridges, expand public transit, and accelerate the shift to electric vehicles.

Navigating Unprecedented Challenges

His tenure has not been without significant hurdles. The COVID-19 pandemic brought about major disruptions to supply chains and public transit systems, demanding swift policy responses and coordination with stakeholders nationwide. Additionally, Buttigieg faced political pushback over funding allocations and the administration’s climate-focused transportation agenda.

Despite these obstacles, the Department of Transportation (DOT) has made strides in addressing critical infrastructure needs. Major projects have been launched to rebuild aging bridges, modernize ports, and expand broadband access in rural areas. The department also prioritized safety initiatives, such as measures to reduce traffic fatalities and improve railway safety.

Championing Equity and Innovation

Buttigieg’s tenure has been notable for emphasizing equitable transportation access. He advocated for programs designed to address systemic inequalities, including efforts to reconnect historically marginalized communities divided by past infrastructure decisions.

Innovation also became a central theme under Buttigieg’s leadership. The DOT fostered initiatives to support the development of autonomous vehicles and bolster electric vehicle charging networks, positioning the U.S. as a leader in next-generation transportation technologies.

Looking Ahead: A Legacy of Transformation

As Buttigieg prepares to leave his post, many are evaluating his legacy. Proponents laud his strategic vision and the progress made under his leadership, while critics highlight areas where they believe more aggressive action was needed. Nonetheless, the groundwork laid during his time at the DOT is expected to shape America’s transportation future for years to come.

Buttigieg’s departure marks a return to where he started: a committed public servant dedicated to tackling the complex issues of transportation and infrastructure. Whether his next steps involve a return to local governance, continued national service, or entirely new endeavors, his time as Transportation Secretary stands as a testament to leadership through challenging times and a vision for a more connected, equitable America.

Conclusion

As Buttigieg closes this chapter of his career, the nation’s transportation systems continue to evolve, fueled by his department's foundational efforts. His journey from South Bend to Washington, D.C., and back to the roots of service reflects the enduring importance of public leadership in shaping America's infrastructure and connecting its people.","Make an article of the title ""Transportation Secretary Buttigieg nears end to his post where he started""",fake,1
"Transportation Secretary Buttigieg nears end to his post where he started.

Ten days from the end of his term as U.S. secretary of transportation, Pete Buttigieg spent a thoughtful and reflective day in Pittsburgh Friday that he dubbed “boats, trains, planes and automobiles.”

The Pittsburgh visit was the latest in a series of trips Buttigieg has made across the country in the past few weeks as the Biden administration winds to an end after one term. It would be inaccurate and mean to call the trips a sort of victory tour, but Buttigieg said he wanted to get one final look at some of the 72,000 projects that started during the administration’s infrastructure blitz.

For his final local tour in the cabinet position, Buttigieg had the ultimate Pittsburgh transportation day: He rode a Gateway Clipper boat down the Ohio River to hear about lock conditions, took the subway four stops to learn about plinth, talked up infrastructure accomplishments with United Steelworkers members, watched demonstrations of Carnegie Mellon University transportation research at Hazelwood Green, and toured construction of the new terminal at Pittsburgh International Airport. Maybe the only thing missing was a trip up Mount Washington on the Monongahela Incline.

Through it all, Buttigieg came across as friendly, sharp, inquisitive and keenly aware of the importance of the topics at hand.",https://www.unionprogress.com/2025/01/12/transportation-secretary-buttigieg-nears-end-to-his-post-where-he-started/,real,0

"World-Class Automotive Manufacturing City Gaining Momentum and Accelerating.

In the past year, BYD has continued to race ahead at full speed. It became the first in the world to roll off its 10-millionth new energy vehicle, launched high-end new models like the Yangwang U9, Tengshi Z9, and Z9GT, and achieved monthly sales surpassing 400,000 and even 500,000 units.

Behind BYD's record-breaking achievements is the accelerated rise of a world-class automotive manufacturing city. In 2024, BYD continued to increase its investment in the Shenzhen-Shantou Special Cooperation Zone, signing agreements for Phase III and IV of the Shenzhen-Shantou BYD Automotive Industrial Park. Phase I has reached full capacity, Phase II's production is steadily climbing, and Phase III is under construction, providing strong support for BYD's participation in international competition.

In 2024, the Shenzhen-Shantou Special Cooperation Zone has taken full advantage of the momentum to accelerate its development, with various sectors continuously showcasing new vitality. In the first three quarters, the region’s GDP grew by 58% year-on-year. A development pattern focused on the new energy vehicle industry, supported by new energy storage, high-performance materials, and intelligent manufacturing equipment industries, is rapidly forming, fueling the rise of this world-class automotive manufacturing city.

Currently, the Shenzhen-Shantou Special Cooperation Zone is aiming to “strengthen and solidify the high-quality development strategy engine for the eastern region” and is deeply implementing the “Hundred, Thousand, Ten Thousand” project. It is accelerating the construction of the core area of Shenzhen's next-generation world-class automobile city and pushing forward the economy’s continuous and rapid development with vigor.

**Reform and Innovation Stimulate Synergy for High-Quality Development**

The Shenzhen-Shantou Special Cooperation Zone was born out of cooperation and thrives on reform and innovation.

In the past year, the zone has focused on “improving the management system and supporting policies of the Shenzhen-Shantou Special Cooperation Zone,” pushing forward the implementation of the “Shenzhen-Shantou Special Cooperation Zone Regulations,” and making good use of the “key move” to advance legal frameworks. This has helped deepen reform and implement the mission of regional coordinated development, creating a strong synergy for high-quality development.

The zone has also established and refined an assessment system and created a clear direction for entrepreneurship. The spirit of Shenzhen-Shantou—being “especially capable of taking responsibility, innovation, pragmatism, hard work, and tolerance”—has been increasingly evident in the practice of deepening reforms.

With a balanced development of new urbanization and industrialization, the Shenzhen-Shantou Special Cooperation Zone has effectively carried out the reform requirements of the “Hundred, Thousand, Ten Thousand” project, promoting both new industrialization and urbanization. The path of urban-rural integrated development is widening.

Supported by the regulations, rural comprehensive reforms have deepened, particularly in rural collective property rights, which have fostered new growth drivers for urban-rural integration. In 2024, the zone signed 5 new village-enterprise cooperation projects and started 4 new projects. The first collective forest land transfer pilot project in the city was successfully auctioned. A more diversified land use and supply model has been perfected, providing more room for industrial development and tangible benefits to the people.

Over the past year, the zone has introduced a new rural planning system with a “two-layer, one-rule” framework, revitalizing the construction of harmonious villages. Ten new nodes were added to the “colorful” urban-rural demonstration belt, and Da’an Village and Hongluo Village were included in the first batch of village revitalization demonstration villages in Guangdong. Significant progress has been made in modernizing agriculture and rural areas.

**Enhancing the Business Environment Through Reform**

The Shenzhen-Shantou Special Cooperation Zone has been continuously optimizing key areas and crucial links in the business environment, creating a business atmosphere that aligns with Shenzhen's “same city, same quality, same effect.”

A new project model—“government guidance, state-owned enterprises accompanying, and private enterprises operating”—has delivered fruitful results, with businesses able to “move in with their bags” to customized factory buildings. The zone has focused on land preparation and secured land policy support, ensuring ample supply of high-quality contiguous land and industrial space. Over the past year, the zone’s high-quality industrial ecosystem has been optimized, attracting strategic emerging industries and creating a strong magnetic field.

In the past year, the zone has explored and deepened social investment and financing mechanisms, utilizing local government special bonds, general bonds, and ultra-long-term special national bonds to attract more social capital into industry investment funds. The total amount of financing from various channels reached 3.62 billion yuan.

"Deadly crash temporarily closes Highway 55 in Plymouth.

PLYMOUTH, Minn. — Part of a north metro highway shut down briefly Saturday night after a driver fatally struck a pedestrian crossing against the traffic light.

The Minnesota State Patrol says the incident happened around 8:20 a.m. at the intersection of South Shore Drive and Highway 55.

A Subaru Forester had been traveling eastbound on Highway 55 when the driver struck a pedestrian in the intersection, according to the crash report.

Authorities say the Subaru had the green light and the pedestrian, a 70-year-old man from Minneapolis, had been crossing against the traffic light and had not been in the crosswalk. The Minnesota State Patrol suspects the pedestrian may have been under the influence of alcohol.

The medical examiner later identified the pedestrian as Volodymyr Pernerovsky and ruled the death an accident.

Deadly Crash Temporarily Closes Highway 55 in Plymouth

Plymouth, MN — Tragedy struck on Highway 55 in Plymouth early Saturday morning when a multi-vehicle collision resulted in the death of one person and left several others injured. The crash, which occurred just before dawn, caused significant disruptions to traffic as emergency responders worked to clear the scene and assist those affected.

Incident Details

According to preliminary reports from the Plymouth Police Department, the crash involved three vehicles, including a semi-truck and two passenger cars.

The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) provided updates throughout the day, advising drivers to seek alternate routes while cleanup and investigation efforts were underway. By early afternoon, the highway was reopened to traffic.

"Village Pet Foundation: A lifeline for pets in crisis.

In the heart of communities across the country, the Village Pet Foundation is making a profound difference in the lives of pets and their families. Established with a mission to support animals in need during emergencies, the foundation has become a beacon of hope for those facing unexpected challenges.

Whether it’s providing temporary shelter for pets displaced by natural disasters, covering the cost of urgent veterinary care for low-income families, or offering free food and supplies to struggling pet owners, the Village Pet Foundation ensures that no animal is left behind. The organization partners with local shelters, veterinarians, and volunteers to create a network of resources that can respond quickly and effectively to crises.

One of the foundation’s standout programs is the “Crisis Care Fund,” which helps families cover medical expenses for their pets when emergencies strike. For Sarah Martinez, a single mother of two in Arizona, the fund was a lifeline when her dog, Max, needed emergency surgery after being hit by a car. “Without their help, I don’t know how I would’ve managed,” she said. “They gave Max a second chance at life.”

In addition to direct support, the Village Pet Foundation focuses on education and prevention. Workshops on disaster preparedness for pet owners and partnerships with community groups aim to reduce the impact of future crises.

The foundation’s executive director, Linda Harper, believes their work goes beyond pets. “When you save a pet, you’re supporting a family. For many, pets are their closest companions, and helping them is helping people, too,” Harper explained.

With growing demand for its services, the Village Pet Foundation relies heavily on donations and volunteers. Their upcoming fundraising gala, “Paws for a Cause,” promises to bring together animal lovers and advocates to ensure the foundation can continue to serve as a lifeline for pets in crisis.

As communities face increasing challenges from economic hardships to climate-related disasters, the Village Pet Foundation is proving that compassion and collaboration can make all the difference—one pet at a time.",generate a news article that fits this title Village Pet Foundation: A lifeline for pets in crisis,fake,1
"Village Pet Foundation: A lifeline for pets in crisis.

INCLINE VILLAGE, Nev. – For pet owners in the Tahoe Basin facing impossible choices between unaffordable veterinary care and losing their companions, the Village Pet Foundation (VPF) has emerged as a beacon of hope. Founded in July 2023 by a dedicated group of animal welfare volunteers, this nonprofit is rewriting the narrative for families in financial distress, saving pets from euthanasia and giving them a second chance at life.

“Usually when I talk to people, they’re at their wits’ end. Their pets are dying. They can’t afford it. They’re just looking for help,” Pat Abbey, Founder and Chairperson of VPF, said.

In just 18 months, the organization has saved 78 pets, far surpassing its initial goal of aiding 25 animals per year. These rescues include cases like Oso, a nine-year-old Labrador mix rescued from a suspected dog fighting ring. Oso’s life took a turn for the better when VPF funded her emergency care, ensuring her safety and recovery.

Operating throughout the Tahoe Basin, including Truckee, the East and West Shores, South Lake Tahoe, and extending to areas like Carson and Fernley, the foundation’s impact is built on partnerships with six local veterinary clinics. By directly paying clinics for services—averaging $2,000 per case—VPF streamlines care for pets in critical condition. Funding comes primarily from a local thrift store, alongside grants, private donations, and community fundraisers.

The inspiration for VPF came from a stark reality: the dire lack of affordable pet healthcare. A veterinary technician, now working with a partner clinic in Incline Village, shared her experience from a Bay Area hospital with Abbey, where 59 pets were euthanized in a single month because their owners couldn’t afford treatment.

The organization’s cases are often life-or-death situations—95% of the pets they’ve helped would have faced euthanasia without intervention. Despite the emotional toll of these cases, the foundation’s team remains focused solely on the welfare of the animals.

“We’ve made a promise to never turn away a pet in need,” Abbey said.

VPF’s rapid growth reflects the overwhelming demand for its services. Originally envisioned as a small-scale operation, the foundation has quickly expanded its reach, with calls for assistance now coming from Arizona. The nonprofit recently opened a second thrift store specializing in furniture and plans to launch a dog grooming facility to bolster its financial base. Immediate priorities include acquiring a van for furniture pickups and enhancing outreach to connect with underserved communities.

Operating entirely with volunteers, the organization’s charter prohibits paid staff, ensuring funds are directed to pet care. However, this commitment presents challenges in managing growth, professionalizing operations, and improving marketing to attract corporate sponsorships.

Looking ahead, VPF aims to extend its reach, particularly in underserved areas like southern Nevada, and secure additional funding to meet the surging demand for services. 

For Abbey and her team, the reward is in the results—watching pets once at death’s door recover and return to their families.
