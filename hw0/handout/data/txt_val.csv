"This British TikToker is Pittsburgh's biggest fan.

If you’re a TikTok user in Pittsburgh, chances are Harrison Szep has appeared on your feed. The floppy-haired, blonde, 20-something U.K. native has dedicated his account to Pittsburgh, a city he adopted after trading soccer for a life on the road.
Szep, who first came to the U.S. to play soccer, had an agent in England who handled his recruiting process. According to Szep, the agent “did not do a good job” and sent him to the University of Findlay in Ohio. Feeling out of place, the Cleethorpes, England native created his own business helping high school soccer players get recruited.

Szep tells Pittsburgh City Paper that Findlay ""wasn’t particularly bad,"" it just wasn’t what he expected. He wasn’t a fan of the rural area or the lack of international students.
“If I was aware of these things before I went, I wouldn’t have gone, but my actual experience at the school wasn’t terrible,” he says.

Szep then embarked on a nomadic lifestyle (he’s been to 27 states), trying out different places for a month each. Szep and his girlfriend, Kiaja Bledsoe, whose workplace has a branch in Pittsburgh, rented an Airbnb for one month. After just three weeks, he decided to stay in the city until May.

He says the city has been the friendliest place he’s stayed thus far.

“I’m not saying other places weren’t friendly, but here, it’s just on another level,” he says. “The people have embraced me and taken me in like their own family.”

His TikTok has been “flooded with positivity,” he says. Many call Szep Pittsburgh’s biggest fan and talk about how much they enjoy seeing Pittsburgh through his eyes.

Szep tried Aiello’s pizza and got a comment on the post from the heiress to the Aiello pizza throne, Nina Aiello, herself. He tried pierogies for the first time, calling his first bite, “weird, like you’re biting into air, then you’re greeted with a bit of mashed tatey.” He cites The Grand Concourse and Ritual House as his two favorite local restaurants.

Szep was declared an honorary yinzer when, on Dec. 8, the Steelers invited him to his first NFL game versus the Browns. He was even gifted an on-field pass and snapped a selfie with running back and kick returner Cordarrelle Patterson.

Szep attended Light Up Night and posted his reaction to the tree and skating rink at PPG Place. Multiple radio stations reached out to Szep and he “just picked a random one,” ultimately going with STAR 100.7. He also collaborated with the University of Pittsburgh, attending a women’s volleyball game.

“I’m getting all these different Pittsburgh-based companies reaching out to me, and it’s all very new,” he says. “Pittsburgh’s people are the absolute best thing about Pittsburgh.”",https://www.pghcitypaper.com/arts-entertainment/this-british-tiktoker-is-pittsburghs-biggest-fan-27312707,real,0

"Western Massachusetts Coalition for Palestine holds rally and march in Amherst.

At 1 p.m. on Oct. 5, dozens of local students and community members congregated at the Amherst Town Common for a pro-Palestinian march and rally organized by the Western Massachusetts Coalition for Palestine (WMC4P).
Several speeches were held at the common to begin the rally, all calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon. There have been consistent protests locally and globally including on the UMass campus, sparked by the events of Oct. 7, when Hamas militants launched an attack on parts of southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and abducting about 250 people, mostly civilians.
In the year since, Israel has launched an aerial and ground bombardment of Gaza that has killed 42,000, more than half of whom are women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
On Sept. 23, Israel launched its most intense aerial bombardment of Lebanon since a month-long conflict in 2006. Israel launched a ground invasion of Lebanon on Sept. 30, killing almost 2,000 Lebanese. In addition, 1.2 million Lebanese have been driven from their homes, the Associated Press reported.
The rally also highlighted the 130 people arrested on May 7 during a Gaza solidarity encampment on South Lawn at UMass’s campus.
Along with as an emphasis on the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, an organization that “works to end international support for Israel’s oppression of Palestinians and pressure Israel to comply with international law,” according to their website.
Multiple local organizations tabled at the rally, among them were Valley Families for Palestine, UMass Amherst Faculty for Justice in Palestine, and Jewish Voice for Peace in Western Massachusetts.
Hoang Phan, English professor at UMass Amherst, led the rally, introducing speakers and directing the crowd during the march.
Leyla Moushabeck, Palestinian-American, local activist and co-founder of Valley Families for Palestine, led the first round of speeches.
“Our movement is growing,” Moushabeck said, “It has been a devastating few weeks of a devastating year, and the work can seem insurmountable. In these moments, our strength is in our solidarity.”
A small group of about 10 counter-protesters stood behind the speakers on the common. Two were holding the Israeli flag, and others held signs reading, “Bring them home now–ALIVE,” and “Don’t abandon Israel.”
Louai Abu-Osba, a Palestnian-American and local activist, spoke about the need for community during this period and the growth of the pro-Palestinian movement in the past year. He referenced a counter-protest he attended when he was a Hampshire College student in the early 2000s, where he and one other friend were the only two at that event supporting Palestine.
“We were vastly outnumbered [at the counter-protest],” he said, looking out to the large crowd before him, “so this is incredible progress for me and is deeply satisfying.”
At 2:30 p.m., the crowd began a march towards the UMass Amherst campus, going down N. Pleasant St. More speeches were held at Kendrick Park on N. Pleasant St.
Community member Hanan Yaktin, a person of Lebanese-American descent and has been affected personally by the violence in Lebanon, spoke at the rally.
She began her speech with a message of peace. “I pray that peace descends upon this entire Earth. There is nothing needed more than that right now.”
Yaktin described an extended trip to Lebanon she took with her three children in the summer of 2006, when Israel carpet-bombed Lebanon in a 34-day conflict with Hezbollah.
“I was obviously horrified, and terrorized,” Yaktin said, “I always thought that I would come back and tell others what we experienced, but I never had the chance.”
“So today I’m remembering that promise to myself and telling you, what is going on [in Gaza and Lebanon], is terrorism, in the worst sense of the word,” Yaktin said.
At 3:30 p.m., the march continued to the public roadway across from the Haigis Mall on Massachusetts Ave. Where the march and rally ended around 4 p.m.

"Bengaluru has third slowest traffic in the world, finds TomTom Traffic Index .

Bengaluru, India – The bustling tech hub of Bengaluru has earned an unenviable distinction: it ranks as the third slowest city for traffic globally, according to the latest TomTom Traffic Index report. Known for its vibrant startup ecosystem and booming IT industry, the city’s infrastructure is now grappling with the challenges of rapid urbanization and population growth.
The report, which analyzed traffic data from over 400 cities worldwide, revealed that commuters in Bengaluru spend an average of 250 hours annually stuck in traffic. This means that for every hour of travel, approximately 30 minutes are lost to congestion, causing significant economic and social repercussions.
“The findings highlight the critical need for sustainable urban planning and investment in public transport infrastructure,” said Arvind Rao, a transport expert and urban planner based in Bengaluru. “With the city’s vehicle population exceeding 10 million, the strain on existing road networks is immense.”
Whitefield, Electronic City, and Outer Ring Road were identified as the most congested areas, as these are hubs for major IT parks and residential complexes. Peak traffic hours see vehicles crawling at an average speed of just 10 km/h, frustrating commuters and affecting productivity.
To combat the worsening situation, the Karnataka government has announced a series of initiatives. These include the construction of additional metro lines, road-widening projects, and the introduction of smart traffic management systems. The much-anticipated Namma Metro Phase 2 is expected to ease traffic flow, but delays in its completion have left many residents skeptical.
“We’ve been hearing promises for years, but tangible improvements are yet to be seen,” lamented Priya Mehta, a software professional who spends nearly three hours commuting daily. “Until public transport becomes reliable and efficient, people will continue relying on private vehicles.”
Environmental experts have also raised concerns over the impact of traffic congestion on air quality. According to a recent study by the Center for Science and Environment, Bengaluru’s vehicular emissions contribute significantly to its deteriorating air quality, with particulate matter levels often exceeding safe limits.
Startups in the city are stepping in to address the issue. Companies like UrbanFlow and QuickRide are promoting carpooling and ride-sharing solutions, while tech-driven platforms are optimizing route planning to minimize delays. “Technology alone cannot solve the problem,” cautioned Rao. “There needs to be a concerted effort involving policymakers, citizens, and private players.”
Despite these challenges, experts remain optimistic about Bengaluru’s potential to turn the tide. “Other cities have overcome similar issues with the right mix of policy reforms and technological advancements,” said Dr. Meera Iyer, an urban studies researcher. “Bengaluru can leverage its status as a tech powerhouse to pioneer innovative solutions.”
For now, however, residents must navigate the daily grind of traffic jams, hoping that the city’s future mobility plans will bring much-needed relief.","Write a news article based on the news title provided to you about a local news taking place in the city of Bengaluru.

"Bengaluru has third slowest traffic in the world, finds TomTom Traffic Index .

Bengaluru’s infamous traffic meant the city was ranked third slowest in travel time, after Barranquilla in Colombia and Kolkata, in the global traffic index for 2024 by Tom Tom, a Dutch location technology firm. Bengaluru was sixth in 2023 and second in 2022. According to the report, the average duration to traverse 10 km in Bengaluru was 30 minutes and 10 seconds, which is 50 seconds more than the time in 2023. In the congestion level index, the city is ranked 68, which is a 4% jump compared to 2023. The data shows that the average travel time in Barranquilla was 36 minutes and six seconds, and in Kolkata it was 34 minutes 33 seconds. Barranquilla and Kolkata were ranked 16th and 169th respectively in the congestion level index. The average speed in Bengaluru was 17.6 km/hour and this was 0.5 km/hour slower than in 2023. The average speed in Barranquilla was 21.6 km/hour and it was 14.5 km/hour in Kolkata. Owing to the slow-moving traffic, time lost during rush hours in 2024 in Bengaluru was 117 hours. The data for Bengaluru shows that October 5 (Saturday) was the worst day, with drivers taking 39 minutes and 21 seconds to travel 10 km. The congestion level on that day was 58%. In the morning rush hour, the average duration of the travel was 38 minutes and 50 seconds, with an average speed of 15.5 km/hour. The evening rush in 2024 saw an average travel time of 41 minutes and 59 seconds. The congestion level in the morning rush was 55% and it was 68% in the evening. Ashish Verma from the Indian Institute of Science said that though the TomTom Traffic Index is a widely recognised tool for analysing urban traffic congestion, covering 387 cities across 55 countries, its reliance on GPS-equipped vehicles limits its scope and depth, failing to account for factors like travel mode variations, seasonal changes, and urban land use.
“While the average travel time serves as a key metric, this narrow focus overlooks critical aspects such as accessibility, public transport quality, and urban planning policies, including parking allocation and high-occupancy vehicle lanes,” he said.
“The index also applies European standards universally, ignoring spatial and cultural differences, which can lead to biased results and misguided policies. Expanding the index to include additional metrics like emission levels, fuel consumption, and road network intensity could provide a more comprehensive view of transportation systems, reflecting efficiency and environmental impact,” he added.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bengaluru-has-third-slowest-traffic-in-the-world-finds-tomtom-traffic-index/article69089432.ece,real,0

"CT schools report better grades, attendance under new cellphone rules.

January 12, 2025 — Hartford, CT
In an era of digital distraction, many Connecticut schools have introduced strict cellphone bans with promising results, according to local school officials. Reports from a growing number of districts suggest that students are more focused, grades are improving, and attendance is rising as a result of these policies.
Increased Focus Leads to Improved Grades

At New Haven High School, Principal Angela Davis points to the cellphone ban as a key factor in the school’s significant improvements in academic performance over the past year. ""We’ve seen an uptick in student grades, and I believe that reducing distractions in the classroom has played a big role,"" Davis said.

Studies conducted by the district show a noticeable improvement in GPA averages across various subjects. Teachers have also reported fewer disruptions during lessons, allowing for more productive class time. While students initially resisted the changes, many are now acknowledging the benefits, according to surveys.

""It's honestly been a relief,"" said Jason Rodriguez, a senior at New Haven High. ""I used to be on my phone constantly, but now that it's not allowed, I’ve found it easier to focus on my work.""
Attendance Rates Improve

Beyond academics, the cellphone ban appears to be impacting student attendance as well. Schools that have implemented the policy report a decrease in absenteeism, particularly among students who had been chronically late or skipped class due to distractions.

In Stamford, Superintendent Michelle Lee shared that attendance has risen by 15% since the cellphone policy was put in place. ""With fewer distractions, students are more engaged and motivated to attend class regularly,"" Lee noted. ""We’ve noticed a positive shift in their overall behavior and academic commitment.""

Data suggests that students are spending less time on social media during school hours, leading to fewer late arrivals and improved time management. Teachers and counselors have also observed a general increase in students’ social interactions in person, as opposed to the digital communication that once dominated.
Challenges and Student Pushback

Despite the positive results, the ban has not come without its challenges. Some students and parents argue that the policy infringes on personal freedom, especially in an age where smartphones are integral to socializing and even some educational activities.

""I understand the need for limits, but I feel that it’s unreasonable to ban cellphones entirely,"" said Emily Chen, a junior at Bridgeport High School. ""In some classes, we use our phones to look up information or collaborate on projects, and now we have to do everything the old-fashioned way.""

School officials have acknowledged these concerns but emphasize that the overall benefits outweigh the drawbacks. ""We do understand the importance of technology in modern education,"" said Dr. Henry Thompson, a spokesperson for the Connecticut Department of Education. ""That’s why we’ve made exceptions for certain situations where phones may be needed for specific learning activities.""
Looking Ahead: Potential for Broader Implementation

With the success of cellphone bans in several districts, other schools in Connecticut are beginning to follow suit. The policy’s increasing popularity has sparked discussions about expanding the ban statewide. Several education advocates argue that a uniform approach could further enhance student performance and well-being.

""As we gather more data, we’re seeing clear evidence that limiting cellphone usage in school can foster a more focused and respectful learning environment,"" Dr. Thompson said. ""While we’re not ready to make any statewide mandates just yet, the trend is definitely moving in that direction.""

As more schools evaluate the effectiveness of these bans, it seems likely that cellphone policies will remain a hot topic in the education landscape for years to come. The results so far suggest that for many students, fewer distractions might just mean a better chance at success.","Generate a realistic 4-section news article ""CT school officials say they're seeing higher grades, better attendance with cellphone bans""",fake,1
"CT schools report better grades, attendance under new cellphone rules.

When officials at Manchester High School reviewed student data after the first marking period, they noticed a curious trend: Just about every data point had improved.

The high school, which had recently rolled out a new cellphone policy requiring students to store their phones in magnetically locked Yondr pouches, saw ""significant"" changes in patterns of student behavior during the first quarter, principal Katelyn Miner said. Students, she said, were getting into fewer fights and showing up to class more consistently compared to a year ago.

Grades improved as well, with students earning more As and Bs and fewer Fs, a trend that Miner said ""got our attention"" because grade distributions are ""notoriously hard to shift.""

She credited the improvement to the new cellphone policy, something many schools across the state have also recently embraced or are about to.

""When all of your data points get better quickly like that in one quarter,"" she said, ""I think there has been a significant impact.""

Since cellphone rules went into effect at the beginning of the 2024-25 school year, some Connecticut school districts said they have seen measurable improvement in key areas, most notably academic achievement, attendance and discipline. 

Officials said the policies have led to fewer distractions, greater engagement and improved relationships between students and staff.

Last August, the state Department of Education issued guidelines – at the request of Gov. Ned Lamont – for restricting cellphone use in Connecticut schools. Education officials stopped short of proposing a cellphone mandate, giving districts the freedom to craft regulations they felt would best serve their students.

For the second year in a row, Lamont, who has been outspoken in his criticism of cellphone usage in schools, discussed the topic during his recent State of the State address, touting the early results of the new cellphone policies.

""We also have more counselors at our schools, and I am told that getting smartphones out of the classroom has been incredible for learning and good for the soul,"" Lamont said. ""Let’s keep that progress going. Many schools are getting phones not just out of the classroom but out of the school all together.""

Promising results

Miner said the number of As and Bs earned by Manchester High School students in the first quarter increased by 4%, while the number of Fs decreased by 3%, compared to last year.

In addition to getting better grades, MHS students were disciplined at a far lower rate for incidents unrelated to cellphone use, such as skipping class and physical fights. During the first quarter, MHS reported 369 non-cellphone disciplinary incidents, down from 1,040 such incidents a year ago. MHS issued 900 cellphone offenses during the first quarter of the current academic year, data shows. The school did not track these infractions in previous years.

Attendance at MHS also improved, with the rate of chronically absent students dropping from 25% at the end of last year to 18% after the first quarter of 2024-25.

""I’m really proud of our student body for managing those emotions about being expected to put their phone away and then being willing to see, 'Hold on, there are some positive outcomes because of that,'"" Miner said.

Other districts that implemented or upgraded cellphone policies this year reported similar improvements in their student data.

In New Canaan, officials at Saxe Middle School received fewer reports of bullying, Superintendent of Schools Bryan Luizzi said. 

Luizzi said he believes the decline in bullying incidents is ""directly related"" to student cellphone use during the school day.

""Often, feuds start online and (spill) into the real world,"" he said. ""Since kids aren’t checking those things during the day, I think it has really reduced that.""

Matthew Laskowski, Stamford's interim associate superintendent for middle schools, said rates of chronic absenteeism and counts of student suspensions are on track to improve at the city's five middle schools.

As of Jan. 10, about 15% of Stamford middle schoolers were deemed chronically absent for the current academic year, according to data provided by Laskowski. Last year, the rate of chronic absenteeism at the middle school level was about 22%.

Meanwhile, suspensions, which include both in-school and out-of-school, totaled 207 for the 2024-25 year to date, which, if extrapolated to the end of the year, would fall well below the 590 suspensions handed out in 2023-24, the data shows.

Laskowski surmised the improvements in student discipline and attendance shown so far this year were not caused by any single factor. Instead, he said, they likely were the result of several recent initiatives at Stamford middle schools, including a new bell schedule that allows for staggered release times from classrooms.

""I believe the product of all of those things together have created conditions to improve the climate of the buildings,"" he said.

'There's nobody to text'

At schools that require phones to be placed in Yondr pouches, some students have tried to skirt the rules by keeping their phones in their pockets, allowing them to sneak a text message or check their Snapchat accounts during opportune moments, officials said. Shortly after the start of the year, one not-so-slick New Canaan student who told his teacher he left his cellphone at home was later caught with his phone's flashlight shining through the front pocket of his pants.

With New Canaan teachers enforcing the cellphone ban district-wide, students no longer have an incentive to beat the system, Luizzi said.

""Even if they did have (phones) in their pockets, there’s nobody to text because all of their friends have their things locked up,"" he said. ""When a majority of kids are locking their phones, you’re disincentivized to do the same thing.""

In other districts, including Manchester, some students have handed over dummy phones and continued to carry their working phones throughout the day.

""Do I think we’ve seen some students lock up a burner phone or an old iPhone and then have a phone out a couple of hours later? Sure. I think we’ve seen a little bit of that,"" Miner said. ""But typically that’s the students who are struggling overall with getting the phone away for the day.""

Hamden Superintendent Gary Highsmith recommended against using Yondr pouches at a recent meeting, partly because he said he foresaw students trying to beat the system. Hamden schools are in the process of writing a policy that would prohibit the use of cell phones and other devices during instructional time.

""Students are crafty,"" Highsmith said. ""You can just look on YouTube and get a hack for the pouch in order to open up the pouch and get your phone out.""

Highsmith also warned of a ""growing broken cell phone business"" that sells busted phones for students to use as decoys in school. 

Sydney Betz, a seventh grader at Rippowam Middle School in Stamford, said the transition to a phone-free school day has been easy for her. But many of her friends – accustomed to using their phones at school – find the new policy annoying. 

""Some of them used to call their friends during the school day for some random reason, but now they don’t do that anymore so they can’t talk to them quite as much,"" Betz, 11, said.

While the policy is irritating for some, Rippowam students have begun to embrace it, Betz noted. During the school's annual student-faculty basketball game before the holidays, many more students watched the game without using their phones compared to a year ago, she said.

Early days

School officials said they experienced a few hiccups in the beginning of the year as both students and staff adjusted to the new reality of a phone-free environment. But overall, they said, rollout has been smooth and efforts to curb student phone usage have been paying dividends.

Some Stamford middle schoolers were reluctant to surrender their phones in the early days of the district's policy, Laskowski said. But those conflicts began to subside as officials held firm on their expectations for student conduct.

""When you walk into a building, it’s very rare you’ll see a student in the hallway with a phone in their hand,"" Laskowski said.

Derek Barrientos, an eighth grader at Rippowam, said many of his peers put the new phone policy to the test during the first week of school before they became fully aware of the consequences. Many students since have stopped using their phones out of fear it will get taken away and sent to the office.

Soon, Rippowam will add another deterrent by requiring students' parents or guardians to pick up seized cellphones after the school day is over, said principal Kristina Colmenares.

Middletown students have pushed back on the district's cellphone ban, with some of the students becoming ""emotional"" about the issue, a student representative on the city's Board of Education said. The district's new policy, which took effect last month, also has made it challenging for parents and their children to communicate, the representative added. Administrators, though, have called the initiative a success.

New Haven's cell phone-free policy, which involves Yondr pouches, began at the middle school level in January.

New Canaan took a collaborative approach to creating its cellphone policy at the middle school. 

Luizzi said the district asked teams of middle school students and faculty members to brainstorm how best to eliminate the distraction of phones. Through those workshops, the teams helped designed the system that the middle school currently uses.

Instead of mounting magnets to unlock Yondr pouches on walls, for example, the school keeps them on movable carts so they are more accessible for students at the end of the day. The carts also can be wheeled into the classrooms of teachers who give their students permission to use their devices.

By making students part of the solution, Luizzi said, New Canaan avoided potential disputes over cellphone policies that have unfolded in places like Torrington, whose students walked out in protest of a new policy in 2022.

New Canaan teachers have been storing their phones in pouches, too, hoping to lead by example and show students that ""they are the most important part of their day,"" Luizzi said. ""It’s really sending a very positive message across the school.""

Challenges

One of the biggest challenges of enforcing the new cellphone rules, officials said, has been handling the small groups of students who refuse to comply and helping them understand the benefits of being device-free during school.

Throughout the fall and spring semesters, Manchester High School maintains a ""red list"" of about 30 or 40 students whose phones are locked up in an office at the beginning of the day and returned in the afternoon, Miner said. Often, she said, these ""red listers"" also struggle with attendance, grades or other areas.

Of the high school's roughly 1,700 students, 295 students, or 17%, received more than one cellphone offense during the first quarter, data shows. The number of students who received more than three cellphone offenses during the first marking period was 116, or 7%, according to the data. 

To support red listers, Miner said, MHS administrators shares research with them detailing the effects that good habits can have on their learning. Using printed report cards, MHS faculty also will show students the correlation between cellphone behavior and academic achievement and graduation progress.

""We didn’t just sit with students and say, 'Hey, you broke the rule. Here’s the consequence,'"" Miner said, adding they ""really spent time"" explaining the reasoning for the rules with the students.

Stamford middle school students caught using their phones a second time are considered ""Tier 2"" offenders, Laskowski said. Similar to Manchester, school leadership teams in Stamford have been seeking ""another layer of intervention"" to support those students who repeatedly disobey the rules.

Gloria Nrecaj, a Rippowam eighth grader, said teachers have confiscated her phone about 10 times this year. She called the Rippowam's cellphone policy ""reasonable"" but said she wished teachers were ""a little bit less strict"" and issued warnings before taking away her device.

Nrecaj, who uses her phone ""a lot"" outside of school, said she has struggled to control the impulse to look at her phone during instructional time. ""Once I come to school, it’s hard to just keep it away, "" she said.

To remove the temptation, Nrecaj, 13, said she has tried silencing her phone using the ""Do Not Disturb"" feature and stashing it out of sight in her backpack. When she does, the results have been encouraging.

""I do focus way better when my phone is not near me,"" she said. ""My phone takes me away from paying attention.""

In New Canaan, Luizzi said teachers faced the challenge of reminding students who received gifts over the holidays that they must place all personal electronic devices, including smartwatches and wireless earbuds, into their respective pouches.

While the reduction in bullying and other infractions in New Canaan has been a welcome sign, Luizzi said, the goal behind the district's phone regulations is to empower students to develop responsible relationships with personal technology.

At a recent meeting with more than a dozen former New Canaan students who are now college freshmen, Luizzi said he noticed that none of the students pulled out their phones. The encounter served as a real-life example of the etiquette that New Canaan schools want to instill in their students.

""We’re working to teach them appropriate times and uses,"" Luizzi said. ""We’re not saying that the phones are evil or bad. We’re saying that we need to be in charge of our relationship with personal technology ...

"Imported workers warned against agents.

Imported workers should apply for jobs directly with 14 licensed employment companies rather than relying on unknown agents to ensure legal recruitment procedures in both Hong Kong and the mainland are followed, Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun Yuk-han says.

Sun said some agents had spread rumors claiming that once imported workers are fired, they would be placed on a ""blacklist"" and no longer be allowed to work in Hong Kong.

""As long as the workers do not violate laws themselves, they don't have to worry. The so-called 'blacklist' is merely an intimidation tactic used by lawbreakers,"" Sun said.

As of November 2024, the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme has approved 37,500 quotas for imported workers, totaling 58,000 when combined with industry schemes, addressing labor shortages in various sectors.

Currently, Hong Kong employers can import workers by applying for quotas from the Immigration Department and recruiting through the 14 labor service intermediaries recognized by the mainland's Ministry of Commerce.

Sun reminded imported workers to apply for positions in Hong Kong directly through these licensed intermediaries.

If any labor services engage in illegal practices such as overcharging service fees, the relevant authorities will hold them accountable under the law, he said.

Sun added that some unqualified agents had taken advantage of the information gap between Hong Kong and mainland cities to mislead and deceive workers.

He explained that agents come in various forms and names, with the SAR government's primary concern being whether their actions violate regulations.

For instance, some management companies illegally deduct salaries from imported workers or even steal their bank cards to unlawfully withdraw salaries or charge excessive fees under the guise of management fees, according to Sun.

""These actions constitute illegal behavior, and law enforcement departments have begun to take action.

""We have previously invited relevant imported workers to Hong Kong to provide evidence. The police will address cases involving the theft of imported workers' salaries in accordance with the law,"" he said.

Sun said protecting the legal rights of imported workers is the government's responsibility.

He noted that Hong Kong is one of the few regions where both imported and local workers are protected under the same laws.

""Under labor laws, we treat all workers equally. We encourage any imported workers who feel their rights have been violated to come forward. The government will provide reporting support.

""For those who have returned home but are willing to return to assist with investigations, authorities will offer transportation and accommodation.""

Sun urged workers interested in coming to Hong Kong to check the Labour Department's official website for accurate information.",https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/11/269321/Imported-workers-warned-against-agents,real,0
"Imported workers warned against agents.

Authorities have issued a cautionary warning to imported workers about potential risks and exploitation when dealing with unlicensed or unscrupulous agents. The announcement comes amid a growing number of reports concerning fraudulent practices targeting foreign workers seeking employment opportunities abroad.

According to labor officials, these agents often promise lucrative jobs, high salaries, and ideal working conditions. However, many workers have found themselves in precarious situations upon arrival, including excessive fees, contract violations, and substandard living conditions.

“We urge all foreign workers to verify the legitimacy of recruitment agents and employers before signing contracts or making payments,” said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Labor and Employment. “It’s essential to use officially recognized channels to avoid being defrauded or mistreated.”

The warning comes as global labor markets face challenges with a growing demand for imported workers in sectors such as construction, agriculture, and domestic services. In response, governments in both sending and receiving countries are tightening regulations and increasing awareness campaigns to safeguard worker rights.

Key Risks Highlighted

Exorbitant Fees: Workers are often charged high placement fees, sometimes exceeding legal limits, plunging them into debt.

False Promises: Misrepresentation of job roles, salaries, and working conditions is a common tactic used by fraudulent agents.

Legal Vulnerabilities: Workers may arrive without proper documentation, leaving them exposed to deportation or exploitation.

Preventative Measures for Workers

Authorities recommend the following steps to mitigate risks:

Research Agents: Verify the licensing and reputation of recruitment agencies through official government platforms.

Understand Contracts: Seek legal or professional assistance to review employment contracts before signing.

Avoid Advance Payments: Reputable agencies typically do not demand significant upfront payments.

Contact Embassies: Workers are encouraged to consult their country’s embassy in the destination country for guidance and support.

Government Actions

In addition to raising awareness, governments are stepping up enforcement measures. Regular inspections of recruitment agencies, stricter licensing requirements, and penalties for violations are being implemented. International cooperation is also being strengthened to ensure that labor agreements between nations prioritize worker safety and fair treatment.

Worker advocacy groups have welcomed the warning, noting that education and enforcement are critical in protecting vulnerable individuals. “Many workers are unaware of their rights or how to navigate the complex recruitment process. This initiative could help prevent exploitation,” said a representative from the International Labor Rights Forum.

As the global demand for labor continues to grow, safeguarding the welfare of imported workers remains a pressing issue. Authorities and advocacy groups alike are committed to ensuring that these workers can pursue better opportunities without falling victim to exploitation.

"Air quality in Chennai improved by 43 per cent, says report.

CHENNAI: Chennai may have made progress in its fight against air pollution, as per an analysis by environmental think tank EnviroCatalysts. The report states that the city’s annual average PM2.5 levels have dropped from 49 µg/m3 in 2017, the baseline year for the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), to 28 µg/m3 in 2024, marking a 43% improvement in air quality. However, insufficient monitoring stations and data gaps continue to raise concerns.

Ideally, a city of Chennai’s size should have 30 continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS). However, it currently has only nine. Only seven of these nine stations had data for the full year of 2024. The remaining two in Ennore and Manali, both industrial regions, didn’t have data for nine and seven months respectively.

The analysis also reveals uneven progress across Chennai’s neighbourhoods. Alandur Bus Depot reported the highest annual PM2.5 concentration at 45 µg/m3, while Kodungaiyur recorded the lowest at 13 µg/m3. Four stations reported concentrations at or below 25 µg/m3, meeting India’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), which set the annual PM2.5 limit at 40 µg/m3.

With this, however, Chennai has achieved the NCAP’s set goal of reducing pollution levels by 40% by 2024. Experts believe the city must now target WHO’s interim standard of 15 µg/m3 and eventually strive for the guideline value of 5 µg/m3 to ensure healthier air for its residents.

Sunil Dahiya, founder of EnviroCatalysts, said, “No doubt Chennai has made some progress, but these numbers do not represent the entire city since the number of CAAQMS are less compared to other metro cities. But given the challenges posed by industrial emissions, vehicular pollution, and high levels of fuel combustion, these results are remarkable, and being a coastal city helps as pollutants get dispersed quickly.” Dahiya pointed out that cities like Delhi, which struggle with annual PM2.5 levels nearing 100 µg/m3, can learn from Chennai’s efforts.

He added that better progress could be achieved through stricter industrial emission standards, modernisation of public transportation, and a transition away from fossil fuels in the energy and transport sectors. These measures could help Chennai meet WHO’s interim and long-term air quality targets.

Prabhakaran Veerarasu of Poovulagin Nanbargal, however, warned against removing Chennai from the NCAP list, arguing that doing so could disrupt the flow of resources critical for further improvement, such as air quality monitoring infrastructure and pollution control initiatives.

Prabhakaran said the government must continue financing air quality management programmes and expand the network of monitoring stations to ensure comprehensive and accurate data collection. He highlighted Chennai’s unique opportunity to become the first Indian city to meet WHO air quality guidelines by 2030, given its geographical advantages and current progress.",https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2025/Jan/10/air-quality-in-chennai-improved-by-43-per-cent-says-report,real,0
"Air quality in Chennai improved by 43 per cent, says report.

Chennai, January 11, 2025:
In a promising development for the environment and public health, air quality in Chennai has improved by 43% over the past two years, according to a new report by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB). The report highlights the impact of various initiatives aimed at reducing pollution levels across the city.

Key Findings of the Report
The study analyzed data from 15 air quality monitoring stations across Chennai, focusing on pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The results showed a steady decline in pollution levels, with most areas now recording air quality within the “moderate” range on the Air Quality Index (AQI). The improvement is most evident in residential areas like Besant Nagar and Velachery, which have seen significant reductions in particulate matter concentrations.

Major Contributors to the Improvement
Experts attribute the improvement in Chennai’s air quality to a combination of government policies, technological interventions, and community participation.

Public Transport Enhancements:
The expansion of Chennai Metro Rail and the introduction of electric buses have reduced dependence on private vehicles, cutting vehicular emissions substantially.

Industrial Regulation:
Stricter enforcement of emission norms in industrial zones and the installation of air pollution control devices in factories have reduced industrial pollutants.

Green Initiatives:
Large-scale tree plantation drives and the revival of urban green spaces, such as the restoration of the Adyar Eco Park, have helped absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants.

Awareness Campaigns:
Efforts to curb open waste burning and promote cleaner cooking fuels in suburban areas have further contributed to cleaner air.

Impact on Public Health
The improvement in air quality has had a positive effect on public health, particularly in reducing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases caused by long-term exposure to pollutants. According to health officials, hospital admissions for air pollution-related ailments have decreased by 15% in the last year.

“This is a significant milestone for Chennai. Cleaner air not only improves quality of life but also reduces the economic burden of healthcare costs,” said Dr. Rajesh Kumar, a pulmonologist at a leading city hospital.

Challenges and the Way Forward
Despite the progress, challenges persist. Industrial zones such as Manali and Ennore continue to report higher-than-average pollution levels. Traffic congestion during peak hours and construction activities also contribute to localized pollution spikes.

The TNPCB emphasized that sustaining these improvements will require continued efforts. Upcoming measures include expanding electric vehicle charging infrastructure, promoting rooftop solar installations, and enforcing stricter penalties for pollution violations.

A Model for Urban Sustainability
Chennai’s progress has drawn attention from other Indian cities grappling with air pollution. Environmentalists hope the city’s success story can serve as a model for balancing urban growth with environmental conservation.

For now, the 43% improvement in air quality is a testament to the collective efforts of policymakers, industries, and citizens, offering hope for a greener, healthier Chennai.","Generate news article for the title ""Air quality in Chennai improved by 43 per cent, says report""",fake,1
"State indefinitely pauses progress on Draco drilling development near Erie.

State indefinitely pauses progress on Draco drilling development near Erie
State regulators have placed an indefinite hold on the controversial Draco drilling development project near Erie, citing concerns over environmental impact assessments and community feedback. The decision comes after months of heated debate between developers, local residents, and environmental groups.
The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) announced yesterday that it would require additional environmental studies before considering further permits for the proposed 12-well pad site, located approximately 2,000 feet from Erie's residential areas.
""We need to ensure all potential impacts are thoroughly evaluated before moving forward with any development in this sensitive area,"" said Maria Rodriguez, COGCC's director. ""The proximity to residential zones and concerns about air quality require careful consideration.""
The development, proposed by Summit Energy Partners, had initially planned to begin drilling operations by early 2026. The company estimated the project would create 150 local jobs and generate significant tax revenue for the region.
Local environmental groups, including Erie Citizens for Clean Air, celebrated the decision. ""This pause gives us time to properly assess the real costs of this development to our community,"" said James Chen, the group's spokesperson. ""We've been raising concerns about water table impacts and air quality for months.""
Summit Energy Partners expressed disappointment with the delay but indicated they would comply with additional study requirements. ""We remain committed to working with state regulators and the community to address all concerns,"" said company spokesperson Sarah Mitchell. ""Our project meets or exceeds all current safety and environmental standards.""
The state's decision affects only the Draco development and does not impact other drilling operations in the region. Officials have not provided a timeline for when the additional environmental studies might be completed.
Erie Mayor Patricia Wilson welcomed the pause, stating, ""This gives our community time to engage in meaningful dialogue about the future of energy development in our region while ensuring our residents' health and safety remain the top priority.""","Generate a news article with the title ""State indefinitely pauses progress on Draco drilling development near Erie""

"State indefinitely pauses progress on Draco drilling development near Erie.

Progress on an oil and gas development seeking to drill underneath Erie and Boulder County has been paused by the state following significant public opposition from Erie residents.

On Friday, the Colorado Energy and Carbon Management Commission unanimously decided to stay the Draco Pad project proposed by Denver-based Extraction Oil & Gas.

‘”Stayed” means that the commission has indefinitely halted the proceedings until (Extraction Oil & Gas) can provide the additional analysis necessary to consider the (project),” ECMC Public Information Officer Kristin Kemp wrote in an email.

The Draco Pad project proposes drilling 26 oil and gas wells from a location in unincorporated Weld County near Erie. The wells would be drilled from the site in Weld County and down more than 7,000 feet. Then, the wells would turn horizontally and advance roughly 5 miles out, reaching underneath Erie and into parts of Boulder County.

Erie residents have expressed concerns about the development, with hundreds of written comments submitted to the commissioners and dozens of people speaking during the public hearing. Despite the town’s close proximity to the site and the fact it would drill underneath Erie, the town and its residents would have little influence over the project at the Weld County site because it would not fall within town boundaries.

The commission decided to pause the project so Extraction Oil & Gas can provide a full analysis of an alternate location, which would fall within Erie town limits. That location is south of the closed Denver Regional Landfill and west of the active Front Range Regional Landfill in the parcel previously proposed as the Redtail Ranch development. This location is named Alternative Location #4 in the Draco project application.

At this location, the Draco Pad project would require approvals and permits from the town of Erie. This location was initially removed as an option since it is located within Erie, and the company saw no way it could obtain the necessary permitting.

“This puts the project back in the town of Erie’s hands to help decide how this moves forward and it gives us some time that we need,” said Erie resident Sami Carroll, the founder of Flatiron Meadows Oil & Gas Monitoring Group, a coalition of concerned residents impacted by oil and gas development.

Representatives from Extraction Oil & Gas did not respond to requests for comment on the stay.

David Frank, Erie’s environmental services director, said there’s a lot of uncertainty around the decision and the next steps forward are unclear.

“I think it’s good that the commission is being thorough and I think they were very receptive to the concerns expressed,” Frank said, adding, “I think their decision is reflective of their mission statement and desire to regulate oil and gas in a manner that’s protective.”

Frank said he couldn’t speak to whether a permit application for the Draco Pad would be approved by the town without seeing an application. He can only speculate that Extraction may currently be evaluating options internally about how to move forward.

“I don’t know what the future holds,” Frank said.

The commissioners cited significant public opposition to the Draco Pad project as a factor in its decision to pause the project. It noted the complexity of the project’s multi-jurisdictional nature with being located in Weld County but having the residents of Erie experiencing most of the impact. It also noted that the company included best practices and completed good work on its application for the project.

“This doesn’t eliminate the possibility of the development, but this is a good opportunity,” Carroll said. “It speaks to the power of community and the power of community action and we appreciate the town of Erie’s help in helping the commission see this and thank the commission for taking this position.”",https://www.dailycamera.com/2024/11/19/state-indefinitely-pauses-progress-on-draco-drilling-development-near-erie/,real,0
"Local resident gives back for arts education.

Art is everywhere. In children’s drawings they bring home from school, in chalk drawings, and especially in schools. For one Milton resident, he felt the need to be able to give back to the arts. 

Dan Schutt is the Vice President of Innovation and Change Communications at Fidelity Investments and in his downtime he donates his time to support arts education at Boston Arts Academy serving on the board for the Boston Arts Academy Foundation. His role on the board is to assist in strategy and communications. 

While serving on the board, he, most recently, helped execute the foundation’s 2024 HONORS event, a fundraising gala that brings together artists, educators, and community members to celebrate the arts and raise money for the school.

Schutt has held various leadership positions during his career including, prior to joining Fidelity, leading numerous teams of national and global public relations firms in Boston, serving three years on the board of the Arts & Business Council of Rhode Island, and over 20 years serving on the board of Victory Programs, Inc.

Schutt said that the arts has always been a part of his life since he was a kid with his sister being an artist and his mother having artistic tendencies. 

“She took a lot of art classes,” he said. For himself, music and musical theater were a big part of his childhood. “We all played instruments, my whole family. Music was always on in the house, all types of music.”

Schutt said he was a total band kid, playing trombone for twelve years, was in marching band, in orchestra and musical theater in high school. 

He first heard about and got involved with Boston Arts Academy and the foundation through a meeting with Denella Clark at a Lady Gaga concert. After learning about what Clark did with the Foundation and for the school, Schutt was hooked. 

“I was just blown away by what the organization was able to do, especially as a Boston Public School,” said Schutt. “I started to put more time, donate to it because I just thought it was an amazing cause and then Denella asked me to be on the board.”",https://www.miltontimes.com/news/local/local-resident-gives-back-for-arts-education/article_0ea7a9e6-cddc-11ef-965b-e346c06eeb0c.html,real,0

"In town, Stanley community celebrates winter with style.

Stanley, [State]—This past weekend, the picturesque town of Stanley came alive with the magic of winter as residents gathered to celebrate the season in true community spirit. Against a backdrop of snow-dusted rooftops and icy pine trees, the annual Winter Festival brought warmth, laughter, and a touch of sparkle to the town square.  

The event, organized by the Stanley Community Association, drew families, friends, and visitors from neighboring towns to enjoy a festive lineup of activities. From ice sculpting to live music, the festival offered something for everyone, showcasing the creativity and camaraderie that make Stanley unique.  

**A Town Transformed**  
The heart of the festivities was Stanley Square, transformed into a winter wonderland with twinkling lights, handmade decorations, and a towering, brilliantly lit snowflake centerpiece. Local artisans and vendors lined the streets, selling everything from hand-knitted scarves to homemade hot chocolate, filling the crisp air with the smells of cinnamon and cocoa.  

“This is what winter in Stanley is all about,” said lifelong resident Margaret Hill. “It’s more than just an event—it’s a chance to come together as a community and celebrate what makes our town special.”  

**Family Fun and Festivities**  
One of the festival’s highlights was the annual Snowman Building Contest, where teams competed to create the most imaginative frosty figure. This year’s winning design—a snow dragon complete with icy wings—earned cheers from the crowd and a blue ribbon for its creators, the Johnson family.  

For thrill-seekers, the nearby sledding hill provided hours of fun, while those looking to stay warm enjoyed storytelling by the fireplace in the library. Local musicians took to the stage throughout the day, performing a mix of holiday classics and original songs that had attendees clapping along and dancing in their snow boots.  

Children especially delighted in the arrival of Winter Claus, who rode into town on a horse-drawn sleigh to hand out candy canes and take photos with families. “This is the best day ever!” said 7-year-old Lily Thompson, clutching her new stuffed reindeer.  

**Supporting a Good Cause**  
Beyond the fun, the Winter Festival also aimed to give back. Proceeds from the event supported the Stanley Food Pantry, and attendees were encouraged to bring canned goods to donate. By the end of the day, organizers reported over 500 items collected to help local families in need.  

**Looking Ahead**  
As the sun set and the festival wrapped up with a dazzling fireworks display, residents reflected on the sense of unity the event had fostered.  

“This is what makes Stanley such a great place to live,” said Mayor Robert Carson. “It’s about neighbors coming together to share joy, even on the coldest days.”  

With the success of this year’s Winter Festival, the Stanley community has set the bar high for next year’s celebrations, proving once again that no one does winter quite like this small but spirited town.

"In town, Stanley community celebrates winter with style.

The town of Stanley, about an hour’s drive north of Ketchum, offers both outdoor recreation in a spectacular landscape and a wonderful community.

Whatever the preferred pastime, those who find themselves in Stanley in the winter most likely share a common captivation with the Sawtooth Mountains. Elk herds meander throughout the basin all winter, and wildlife watchers and photographers can discover new and always changing landscapes.

And with the vastly reduced volume of off-season visitors, it is in the winter in particular that the human community becomes tighter, said Dani Hansen, grants and marketing director for the Stanley-Sawtooth Chamber of Commerce.

If the weather outside is frightful—which, as one of the coldest places in the Lower 48, it can be—a trip to Stanley offers just as much to those who prefer to stay close to a fireplace and enjoy the spectacular views from the comfort of town.

For a town of its size, Stanley offers truly remarkable dining, drinking and entertainment options, from a family-friendly pizza joint, local watering holes and late night music venues to a one-of-a-kind menu offered by James-Beard nominated chefs.

And while business hours can be more limited in the winter (always check online or call to confirm), there’s always the Mountain Village Resort, which serves a large menu with options to please any palette, three meals a day, seven days a week, as well as regular movie nights and music. The resort also operates the town’s only gas station and grocery store.

The Stanley Community Library offers not only a place to cozy up or borrow a good book for a blustery day, but a full schedule of events. From fly-tying and chocolate making to yoga and sound healing, the winter calendar is diverse.

There are kids story hours, book clubs and regular presentations by historians and longtime Stanley residents and former residents in partnership with the Sawtooth Interpretive and Historical Association.

This winter’s local oral history programs include talks about the use of ice houses prior to the introduction of electricity, and a presentation from a woman who spent time as a pilot and in the Custer gold-dredge camp.

There are also weekend festivals in Stanley in January and February—big events that draw crowds from across the state and country and can fill every hotel room and cabin in town.

From Jan. 24-26, the town will host the 12th annual Sawtooth Outdoor Bonspiel, a three-day curling tournament featuring 16 teams and hosted by the Boise Curling Club.

The eighth annual Stanley Pond Hockey Tournament will take place from Jan. 31 to Feb. 2. While registration is closed for the event, which brings hockey players from across the country to play on the town’s outdoor ice rink, spectators are welcome. Drawing for teams takes place on Jan. 29.

On the weekend of Feb. 7-8, the Salmon River Snowmobile Club will hold its annual Snowmobilers Ball and Fun Run. Funding from the ball goes toward trail maintenance and grooming.

The town’s biggest winter event—Stanley Winterfest—will take place Feb. 14-15.

Held every Presidents Day weekend for the past 15 years and billed under the motto “Let’s Get Weird,” the family-friendly event features a beach party, homemade outhouse races down Ace of Diamonds Boulevard, raft races down the big sledding hill, adult big-wheel racing, bowling with frozen turkeys, a Drag Race (drag queens on snowshoes), a three-legged race, pickup hockey and ice skating, a pizza-eating contest, live music and a street dance, and more.

All proceeds go back to the community through nonprofit grants.

Also on Feb. 15 is the annual Fat Bike Fondo, where fat bike enthusiasts can gather to ride while enjoying the Winterfest celebrations.

It is held on trails winding through the Stanley Basin and boasting epic views of the Sawtooth Mountains. It offers 20k, 30k and 40k options. Riders can register on the day of the event.

Map Shows How Much Snow Pittsburgh Area Will Get, Starting During Friday Evening's Commute

Residents of the Pittsburgh area should brace for potentially hazardous travel conditions as a winter storm is expected to bring significant snowfall beginning Friday evening. Meteorologists forecast that snow will start falling just as commuters hit the road, creating slippery and challenging driving conditions across the region.
Snowfall Totals and Timing
According to the latest weather models, Pittsburgh and its surrounding areas are expected to see snowfall totals ranging from 2 to 6 inches, depending on elevation and proximity to the city center. Areas to the north and east, such as Butler and Westmoreland counties, may experience higher accumulations closer to the 6-inch mark due to lake-enhanced snowfall. Meanwhile, the downtown Pittsburgh area and nearby suburbs could see closer to 3 inches.

The snow is anticipated to begin around 5:00 PM Friday, intensifying during the evening hours before tapering off overnight into early Saturday morning. The heaviest snowfall rates are expected between 7:00 PM and 11:00 PM, with snow falling at rates of up to an inch per hour in some areas.

Temperature and Road Conditions
Temperatures across the region will hover in the upper 20s to low 30s Fahrenheit, cold enough to ensure that the snow sticks to untreated surfaces. Winds will remain light to moderate, minimizing the risk of significant blowing and drifting snow. However, with pavement temperatures dropping, untreated roads and sidewalks are likely to become icy and treacherous.

Transportation officials have issued advisories urging commuters to plan ahead and allow extra time for travel during the evening hours. ""Our crews will be out pre-treating roads, but drivers should still exercise caution, especially on bridges, overpasses, and secondary roads,"" said a spokesperson for PennDOT.

 Precautions and Recommendations
The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Weather Advisory for much of southwestern Pennsylvania, including Allegheny County. Residents are advised to monitor weather updates and be prepared for potential disruptions.

For those traveling during the snowstorm, experts recommend carrying an emergency kit with essentials such as a flashlight, blankets, water, and a fully charged phone. Additionally, travelers are urged to reduce speeds, increase following distances, and avoid sudden braking or turning to maintain control on slick roads.

Looking Ahead
As the storm moves out of the area by Saturday morning, forecasters expect partly cloudy skies with temperatures rising into the mid-30s. While this may allow for some melting during the day, any residual moisture could refreeze overnight, creating additional slick spots for early Sunday travelers.

Stay tuned to local weather updates and check the PennDOT website for real-time road conditions to ensure a safe start to your weekend.

"Map shows how much snow Pittsburgh area will get, starting during Friday evening's commute.

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — Another round of snow is expected to dump a widespread 1 to 3 inches across the Pittsburgh area, starting during the Friday evening commute. 

The snow moves in right around 5 to 6 p.m. Friday and will continue through the first part of the day on Saturday, with a widespread 1 to 3 inches through the morning. North of Pittsburgh, along with the Laurel Highlands and the ridges, could see 2 to 4 inches. There will still be a few flakes through the day but most of the then-lake effect snow in the afternoon will linger in the Laurel Highlands and ridges and north, which is why those areas are seeing higher accumulation possible.

"From Fredericton to the bright lights, N.B. actor shares highs, lows of making it in musical theatre.

The path to success in the world of musical theatre is rarely a straight line, and for New Brunswick actor [Actor's Name], the journey has been filled with both exhilarating highs and challenging lows. Hailing from Fredericton, [Actor's Name] has navigated the rollercoaster ride of auditions, rehearsals, and performances to carve out a name for themselves on the stage. As they continue to gain recognition, they reflect on the challenges and triumphs that have shaped their career.

Early Days: The Spark of Passion in Fredericton
Growing up in Fredericton, [Actor's Name] was surrounded by the rich cultural heritage of New Brunswick but found their true calling in the performing arts. ""I always loved the idea of storytelling, and musical theatre gave me a way to do that with both my voice and my acting,"" they say. Local productions and high school performances provided the first opportunities to step onto the stage, but it wasn’t until [Actor's Name] attended a summer drama camp that they realized this was more than just a hobby.

""I was always performing around the house, singing in the car, or doing monologues from movies, but it wasn’t until I saw a professional production that I thought, 'I could do this for real.' That was a pivotal moment for me.""

The Leap: Moving to Toronto and Auditioning for the Big Stage
After high school, [Actor's Name] made the bold decision to pursue musical theatre at the post-secondary level, enrolling in a reputable theatre program. Moving to Toronto to attend [Name of School/Program] was an adjustment, but it also opened doors. The bustling arts scene of Canada’s largest city provided new challenges and opportunities, as well as a sense of competition.

""Toronto was a huge shift,"" [Actor's Name] reflects. ""There are so many talented people in this industry, and at first, it can feel overwhelming. You have to learn how to separate yourself from the pack.""

Auditioning in a city filled with talented performers quickly became a humbling experience. Rejection was frequent, but [Actor's Name] maintained their drive. ""You have to remind yourself that auditions are not personal. It’s a numbers game. Sometimes, it’s just about being the right person for the role at the right time,"" they explain.

But it wasn’t all struggle. After several years of hard work and persistence, [Actor's Name] was cast in their first major musical theatre production, a breakthrough role that finally allowed them to showcase their abilities on a larger stage.

The Highs: Stepping into the Spotlight
The thrill of landing that first major role was a high that [Actor's Name] will never forget. ""The first time you step onto a professional stage in front of an audience, it’s pure magic. The adrenaline, the energy from the crowd—it’s unlike anything else,"" they say.

From small roles in community theatre productions to eventually performing in large-scale shows, [Actor's Name] has experienced the rush of bringing a character to life night after night. The joy of performing, of connecting with an audience through song and dance, has been one of the most rewarding aspects of their career.

""The opportunity to perform in Toronto’s vibrant musical theatre scene has been incredible. I’ve been fortunate enough to work with some of the best directors, choreographers, and other actors. It’s a constant learning experience.""

The Lows: Facing the Challenges of the Industry
However, the journey hasn’t been without its difficulties. While [Actor's Name] has found success, the road to getting there has been challenging. Rejection, long hours, financial instability, and the pressures of perfectionism are a few of the difficulties that come with the territory.

""The hardest part is the uncertainty,"" [Actor's Name] confides. ""There are periods of time where you're not working, and that can be really tough mentally and emotionally. You question if it’s all worth it.""

The financial strain of auditioning, sometimes without immediate results, can take a toll. ""You have to be really committed to this career. It’s not easy, and it doesn’t always pay off right away.""

But for [Actor's Name], the lows are just part of the process. They have learned to accept rejection as an opportunity for growth and to focus on the positives in their journey.

Advice for Aspiring Actors
Having experienced both the highs and the lows of the industry, [Actor's Name] has some valuable advice for aspiring musical theatre performers.

""First and foremost, be patient with yourself,"" they emphasize. ""The journey is different for everyone. You may not get everything you want right away, but every experience—good or bad—teaches you something.""

They also advise budding performers to find a community. ""Theatre can be isolating, but having a group of people who understand what you're going through can make a world of difference.""

Looking Forward: What's Next for [Actor's Name]
Looking ahead, [Actor's Name] is focused on growing as an artist and taking on new challenges. ""I love the stage, but I’m also interested in exploring other areas of theatre, like directing or choreography,"" they reveal. ""I want to keep pushing myself creatively and take on roles that challenge me in different ways.""

As they continue their journey from Fredericton to the bright lights of the stage, [Actor's Name] remains committed to their craft and hopeful for the next chapter of their musical theatre career.

""The highs are worth the lows, and every step along the way is part of the story. I’m just grateful to keep telling it.""","generate me an article with the title:

"From Fredericton to the bright lights, N.B. actor shares highs, lows of making it in musical theatre.

Rose Messenger doesn't remember a time in her life when she didn't want to be an actor. 

The 23-year-old grew up in Fredericton attending the Theatre New Brunswick school and doing shows at Fredericton High School.

After graduating, she attended university in Cincinnati, before jetting off to New York City to try to make it in her chosen field.

And for the last several months, she's been living out her dream in another big theatre hub.

""If you had asked me less than a year ago if this is where I thought I would be … I would say, 'No way,'"" Messenger said.

For the last few months, she has been performing with the small cast of Titanique, a musical comedy about the movie Titanic, told through the eyes of Céline Dion.

The Canadian version of the off-Broadway show started in Montreal and is now at the Ed Mirvish Theatre in Toronto — a spot that Messenger calls a dream for any aspiring Canadian musical theatre actor.

Messenger plays one of Dion's background vocalists, but she also understudies the actors who play Dion, Rose and the Unsinkable Molly Brown. She's actually gone on for several performances as Brown. 

""It's my first time understudying multiple roles and it's a cool feeling of, you know, you may never get to do the character, but you've done all the work and you've done all the preparation,"" she said.

""Once you have the chance to do it several times, you really discover your character in front of the audience. And it's weird — you rehearse in front of an audience as an understudy.""

And while the experience of working on a show for many months has been a rewarding one, Titanique will close on Jan. 19, meaning Messenger is back on the job market, and back to the constant whirlwind of auditions.

The life of an actor can be inconsistent.

After graduating from university, she landed her first contract in Anne & Gilbert, on Prince Edward Island, before deciding to move to New York.

Immediately, Messenger said she started working three jobs to survive, being thrust into the reality of an actor trying to land the next contract. 

""You work a morning shift at somewhere, and then you go to your audition in the afternoon and try to act like … all you do is act every day,"" she said. 

""And then you go to your night shift at night, and you go to sleep and do the same thing over and over again.""

It paid off for Messenger. She booked a job in Connecticut where she worked alongside some Broadway veterans — until that, too, came to an end.

""When that show finished, again, my mom was getting a lot of, you know, crying phone calls of ... what's next for me,"" said Messenger.

""I think, for anyone … that goes to theatre school, specifically, you get this idea in your head like, 'Oh, I'm gonna leave school and I'm gonna book, you know, this movie, or I'm gonna book this job, or I'm gonna, you know, become a star immediately.

""It's just not like that for 99 per cent of the people that try to do this.""

As her current contract winds down, Messenger said she plans to visit family back home in New Brunswick before hopefully going back to New York to start the job hunt all over again.

But over the last few years, she's learned the importance of separating her sense of self-worth from the job.

And she's taken up hobbies and friends outside of theatre, as a way to disconnect from the industry.

""It's always just kind of a roller coaster. … but you kind of learn to get in the groove of it.

""It's always exciting.""

"""China's First Musical on Mencius' Philosophy, 'Willow Snow,' Premieres in Zoucheng"".

On December 31, at the Mencius Grand Theater in Zoucheng, Shandong Province, an original musical titled *Liusu Xue* (“Snow of Fringe Trees”) premiered with a dramatic scene of battle echoing through the hall.  

Structured in six acts and inspired by Mencius’s principle of “giving up life for righteousness,” the story takes place after the Jingkang Incident. Protagonist Meng Zhonghuai, undaunted by overwhelming odds, vows to defend a solitary city. His selfless sacrifice on the battlefield forms a stirring ode to heroism and moral integrity.

Experts note how the production cleverly integrates Mencius’s quotations and cultural elements, making Confucian thought more accessible to audiences. By closely intertwining national loyalty and personal fate, the musical explores the inner struggles and choices of its characters, showcasing how the Confucian spirit of “sacrificing life for righteousness” resonates in a historical setting.

Employing a compositional style that blends popular and symphonic music with traditional Chinese ritual elements, the score incorporates ancient instruments such as bianzhong and bianqing. This fusion expands the expressive possibilities of musical theater and highlights the distinctive charm of classical Chinese music—an innovative step toward creating a uniquely Chinese musical form.

In front of the Cishu Library at the Mencius Residence stand two companion fringe trees, more than three centuries old, which bloom like falling snow each April. Their quiet beauty becomes a symbol of hometown longing—an emotional thread woven into the story. In the musical, secondary leads Meng Yi and Han Miaoqing meet under the flourishing fringe trees, only to confront chaos and life‑or‑death choices. In the closing scene, as they bow toward their homeland in swirling snow, the drifting petals evoke both blossoms and snowfall. This recurring motif embodies the essence of Mencius’s teachings, guiding the audience toward deeper reflection.

Although the title *Snow of Fringe Trees* initially suggests a romantic tale, it reveals a grand, somber narrative of national crisis—an unexpected contrast that leaves a strong impression.  

As a new cultural undertaking, *Liusu Xue* is part of Zoucheng’s effort to highlight local character, promote Mencius’s philosophy, and creatively develop traditional Chinese culture. Following productions such as *Liyue Song* and *The Road of Righteousness,* this is China’s first musical themed around Mencius’s thought. With its artistic team and leading actors all hailing from Mencius’s hometown, it reflects the region’s commitment to cultural prosperity and the continuation of Confucian heritage. Having concluded its successful debut, *Liusu Xue* will refine its format to suit various venues and embark on a nationwide tour, bringing the light of Confucian wisdom to broader audiences.",https://jining.iqilu.com/jnyaowen/2025/0101/5762965.shtml,real,0
"""China's First Musical on Mencius' Philosophy, 'Willow Snow,' Premieres in Zoucheng"".

This groundbreaking production explores the timeless wisdom and humanistic spirit of Mencius through a blend of traditional Chinese culture and modern musical storytelling.

The premiere attracted scholars, artists, and cultural enthusiasts from across the country, all eager to witness how Mencius' profound teachings on morality, governance, and human nature were brought to life on stage. Through its poetic script, melodious music, and stunning visuals, the musical offered a fresh and emotionally resonant interpretation of Mencius' ideas, making them accessible to audiences of all ages.

The production was created by a team of talented playwrights, composers, and directors who spent years researching Mencius' works and their historical context. The lead actors delivered powerful performances, skillfully conveying the philosophical depth and emotional intensity of the story.

The city of Zoucheng, known as the birthplace of Mencius, served as the perfect backdrop for the musical’s debut. Local authorities emphasized the significance of this event in promoting traditional Chinese culture and boosting the city's cultural tourism.

Following its successful premiere, ""Willow Snow"" is set to embark on a national tour, aiming to inspire audiences and rekindle interest in Mencius' teachings.

"NJ Doctor Loses License After Exploiting Undocumented Workers, Faces Federal Prison: AG.

A New Jersey doctor has been stripped of his medical license and is facing federal prison time after being accused of exploiting undocumented workers in a shocking abuse of power. The state’s Attorney General, Angela Thompson, announced the charges on Wednesday, detailing a disturbing pattern of exploitation and coercion.

Dr. Richard Calhoun, 52, of Princeton, operated a private medical practice that catered to a broad clientele, including immigrant communities. According to authorities, Calhoun allegedly employed several undocumented workers in his practice, promising them stable employment and assistance with their immigration status. However, investigators revealed that he subjected the workers to inhumane working conditions, withheld wages, and threatened to report them to immigration authorities if they complained.

“Dr. Calhoun’s actions are a gross betrayal of his oath as a physician and a grave violation of basic human decency,” said AG Thompson during a press conference. “No one, regardless of their immigration status, deserves to be exploited and intimidated by someone in a position of trust.”

The investigation, which began in 2022, was sparked by complaints from former employees who claimed they were forced to work long hours without pay and were denied basic workplace rights. Authorities said that Calhoun also leveraged his role as a physician to intimidate his employees, suggesting that he could jeopardize their medical care or immigration prospects.

The federal charges against Calhoun include labor trafficking, wage theft, and obstruction of justice. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted on all counts. In addition to criminal charges, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners revoked his license, effectively ending his medical career.

Community advocates have condemned Calhoun’s actions and praised the whistleblowers who came forward. “This case highlights the vulnerability of undocumented workers and the urgent need for stronger protections,” said Maria Gonzalez, director of the New Jersey Immigrant Justice Network. “We applaud the bravery of the individuals who exposed this abuse.”

Calhoun’s attorneys have denied the allegations, arguing that the accusations are based on “unreliable testimony” from disgruntled former employees. “Dr. Calhoun is a respected member of the medical community who has dedicated his life to helping others,” said defense attorney James O’Reilly in a statement. “We look forward to vigorously defending him in court.”

As the case moves forward, the state’s Attorney General has pledged to continue targeting employers who exploit vulnerable workers. “This is a message to anyone who thinks they can operate above the law,” said AG Thompson. “We will hold you accountable.”

The trial date has yet to be announced, but the case has already drawn significant public attention and ignited debates about labor rights and immigration policies. For now, the undocumented workers involved are receiving support from local organizations as they navigate their legal and personal recovery.","Generate a news article that is the same as the article title give: NJ Doctor Loses License After Exploiting Undocumented Workers, Faces Federal Prison: AG",fake,1

Dr. Harsha Sahni, a rheumatologist based in Middlesex County, was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison for conspiring with others to illegally recruit, conceal, and harbor two women from India to be household servants for low pay, New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said.

Sahni, who practiced in Colonia, admitted in her guilty plea that she knew the women were in the country illegally and that she harbored them for financial gain and caused them both to believe that they would be arrested and deported if they interacted with law enforcement, Platkin said. 

The doctor said she provided the women food, clothing, and housing and harbored them to work as housekeepers at a price less than what she would have had to pay housekeepers had she employed them legally, Platkin said. Sahni acknowledged to instructing the women to tell immigration officials that they were members of her family and in the United States for tourism, knowing that was false, Platkin said.  Sahni admitted in court that she did not pay taxes related to their work, Platkin said.

Sahni also scammed a domestic violence charity into providing free dental treatment for one of the women and later prevented her from receiving treatment for a life-threatening brain aneurysm. When the woman began developing headaches following a car crash in 2014, Sahni told the woman that rest was not permitted and if she had a headache she should take Tylenol and complete her work, Platkin said.

The headaches got so bad, the woman had to be taken to the emergency room, where a CT can showed an unruptured aneurysm in her brain and the woman was told she needed immediate surgery, or face death, Platkin said. Sahni encouraged the woman to leave the hospital against medical advice and required her to work that evening, Platkin said.

In addition to the prison term, Sahni was sentenced two years of supervised release and ordered to pay $728,327. Sahni must also pay up to $200,000 for specific medical bills.

"The Government Council adopts a draft decree relating to the legal minimum wage for agricultural and non-agricultural activities.

Date: January 9, 2025

The Government Council convened today to deliberate on a range of legislative and regulatory measures aimed at enhancing labor conditions across the country. Among the key outcomes of the meeting was the adoption of a draft decree concerning the legal minimum wage for both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors.

A Commitment to Fair Wages

The draft decree underscores the government’s commitment to ensuring equitable pay and improving the standard of living for workers in diverse economic sectors. The proposed changes include an adjustment to the legal minimum wage, reflecting inflationary trends and aiming to reduce income disparities.

For the non-agricultural sector, the decree outlines a percentage increase to align wages with the rising cost of living and to support low-income workers. Similarly, in the agricultural sector, the decree seeks to address the historically lower wages by setting a benchmark that bridges the gap with other industries.

Impact on Workers and Employers

If enacted, the revised minimum wage will benefit millions of workers across the country, offering them greater financial security. Workers in sectors such as construction, manufacturing, retail, and farming are expected to see tangible improvements in their earnings.

However, the decree also acknowledges potential challenges for employers, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To mitigate these impacts, the government has proposed complementary measures, including tax incentives and financial assistance programs, to support businesses during the transition.

Stakeholder Consultations

The draft decree is the result of extensive consultations with labor unions, employer associations, and economic experts. The government emphasized that the adjustments were carefully calibrated to balance the needs of workers and the capacity of employers.

Labor representatives have lauded the move as a step in the right direction, with many calling for further measures to address wage gaps and promote worker welfare. On the other hand, some business groups have expressed concerns about the potential strain on operational costs, particularly in sectors with narrow profit margins.

Next Steps

The draft decree will now proceed to the legislative body for further discussion and ratification. If approved, the new minimum wage rates are expected to come into effect within the next fiscal quarter.

The government has reaffirmed its commitment to continuous dialogue with stakeholders to ensure a smooth implementation and to monitor the socioeconomic impacts of the wage adjustments.

Conclusion

The adoption of this draft decree signals a significant milestone in the government’s efforts to promote social equity and economic resilience. As the legislative process unfolds, all eyes will be on the potential ripple effects this policy may have on the broader economy and labor market.",Generate a news article with the following title: The Government Council adopts a draft decree relating to the legal minimum wage for agricultural and non-agricultural activities,fake,1

“We knew we wanted to keep it small because whenever you have a smaller learning environment, you're able to go even deeper,"" she explains. Capped at 100 attendees, the event emphasizes quality over quantity, creating an environment where DJs can forge deeper connections and engage in high-level discussions about their craft.
“I've only attended a handful of conferences over the years that limit their attendance and I find when a conference does limit their attendance, attendees and speakers are often much more open and vulnerable in their sharing of ideas which can be advantageous,” says Dave Lander, aka Digital Dave, a 2025 summit workshop educator covering the importance of music programming.
His session aims to refocus DJs on the art of curating music, a skill that can sometimes take a backseat to business and marketing efforts. ""Music is the essence of what we do as DJs,"" says Lander.
The summit's structure also offers a unique blend of seminars, workshops, and interactive panels. The mornings feature general sessions with 20-minute presentations and extended keynotes by prominent industry figures. In the evenings, workshops transition attendees from passive learning to hands-on activities. “You’re not just sitting and listening to the education,” says McKelvey. “You’re putting it in motion, which makes it more likely you’ll maintain momentum toward your goals.”
Workshops and presentations will tackle emerging technologies and trends shaping the industry. Mike Salone, aka DJ AXCESS, plans to highlight the potential of AI and tools like STEMS, which allow DJs to separate vocals and instrumentals in real-time. ""As AI makes simple mixing and blending easier, DJs who mix creatively will be the ones to stand out,"" he says.
One of the summit's standout features is its panels, including the much-anticipated wedding pro panel. Moderated by McKelvey, the panel brings together wedding planners, photographers, videographers, and officiants to explore how DJs can collaborate more effectively with other vendors. ""It's about pulling back the curtain to see how we can better support each other,"" says McKelvey.
Another highlight is the DJ-based panel, which promises interactive surprises designed to inspire creativity and foster collaboration.
“When I attended last year, I discovered several apps during the workshops that make event planning faster and easier,” says Santo Scarillo, aka DJ Scar, who will be the on-stage DJ throughout the conference. “Events like these play a crucial role in building friendships, expanding your business, and gaining valuable insights from other DJs in the industry.""
For those who may feel nervous about attending, McKelvey acknowledges, ""It's a scary world out there, especially in the entertainment business.” She encourages first-timers to take the plunge, assuring them of a supportive community filled with compassionate educators and seasoned professionals.
New summit elements this year include a venue shift to the Sheraton Pittsburgh in Station Square, where the nearby Hard Rock Cafe will, on Tue., Jan. 14, host a DJ Takeover party featuring multiple DJs, flash tattoo stations, and surprise activities. A collaboration with Women Who Rock adds a pop-up shop and fundraising effort to the event, blending community engagement with the summit’s celebratory spirit.
“I've participated in a lot of conferences, however, I think it's really incredible for my hometown to be hosting one, says Lander. “I'm definitely looking forward to showcasing our city, which I'm incredibly proud of, to DJs from across the country.”
The Pittsburgh DJ Summit is more than just an industry event — it's a celebration of music, innovation, and community. McKelvey and her team are driven by a desire to share the wealth of knowledge and connections they've gained from years of attending similar events.

.

In a thrilling matchup on Friday night, the South Plainfield Tigers emerged victorious over the North Brunswick Raiders with a 49-44 win. The game, held at North Brunswick High School, kept fans on the edge of their seats as both teams showcased determination and skill until the final buzzer.

South Plainfield's strong defensive performance proved pivotal, as they held off a late surge by North Brunswick in the fourth quarter. Key players for the Tigers included senior guard Marcus Johnson, who led the team with 18 points, and forward Ethan Carter, who dominated the boards with 12 rebounds.

North Brunswick was led by sophomore standout Jason Rivera, who scored 16 points and kept the Raiders competitive with his clutch shooting and playmaking ability. Despite his efforts, the Raiders struggled to capitalize on key possessions in the closing minutes.

“This win was about heart,” said South Plainfield head coach Tim Daniels. “Our boys stuck together, played tough defense, and trusted each other when it mattered most.”

The game was a back-and-forth battle, with neither team leading by more than six points throughout. South Plainfield gained the upper hand midway through the third quarter, going on an 8-2 run fueled by sharp shooting and defensive stops.

North Brunswick fought back in the final quarter, narrowing the gap to just three points with less than a minute remaining. However, South Plainfield’s precision at the free-throw line sealed the victory.

The Tigers improve to 5-2 on the season, while the Raiders fall to 4-3. South Plainfield will face Edison High School next week, while North Brunswick looks to rebound in their upcoming game against Piscataway.

“It’s a tough loss, but we’ll learn from it,” said North Brunswick head coach Paul Sanchez. “The effort was there—we just need to execute better in key moments.”

Fans from both sides are already looking forward to the rematch later this season, as this rivalry continues to heat up.","write the news article with this headline ""Boys Basketball: South Plainfield Beats North Brunswick, 49-44""",fake,1
"Biden administration delays deadline for U.S. Steel, Nippon Steel to kill merger.



The Biden administration has extended the deadline for U.S. Steel Corporation and Nippon Steel Corporation to terminate their proposed merger amid heightened scrutiny over its potential impact on competition and national security. The decision comes as regulators demand additional time to review the deal, which has sparked debate across industry and government circles.

The merger, initially announced in mid-2024, aims to create one of the world’s largest steel manufacturers by combining U.S. Steel’s extensive American operations with Nippon Steel’s global reach and advanced technology. Proponents argue that the merger could enhance innovation and help the companies better compete with China’s steel dominance. However, critics warn that it could reduce competition, increase prices, and jeopardize national security by placing significant control of U.S.-based steel production in foreign hands.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) are conducting separate but overlapping investigations into the merger. The DOJ’s antitrust division is assessing whether the deal would harm domestic competition, while CFIUS is examining the national security implications of allowing a foreign entity to hold substantial sway over a critical American industry.

A spokesperson for the DOJ confirmed the deadline extension but declined to provide specific details, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation. “The Department remains committed to ensuring that any merger complies with U.S. antitrust laws and does not harm American consumers or businesses,” the spokesperson said.

Nippon Steel issued a statement expressing its commitment to cooperating with U.S. regulators. “We are confident that the merger will bring significant benefits to stakeholders in both countries and strengthen the global competitiveness of the steel industry,” the company said. U.S. Steel echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing that the deal aligns with national interests and economic growth.

The extension marks the second time the deadline has been pushed back, reflecting the complexity and sensitivity of the deal. Analysts suggest that the delay signals deeper concerns within the administration about the merger’s ramifications.

“This is not just about antitrust concerns; it’s also about national security,” said Jennifer Michaels, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution specializing in trade policy. “Steel is a vital component for defense and infrastructure, and any consolidation involving foreign entities requires careful scrutiny.”

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have weighed in on the matter. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has called for a thorough investigation, citing potential risks to workers and consumers. “We cannot allow corporate consolidation to harm American families or jeopardize our economic sovereignty,” Warren said in a statement. Meanwhile, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) raised concerns about foreign influence, arguing that the merger could undermine U.S. self-reliance in critical industries.

The Biden administration’s decision to delay the deadline underscores its broader agenda of scrutinizing mergers and acquisitions more aggressively. Since taking office, President Biden has emphasized the need to curb corporate concentration and protect national interests, appointing antitrust reform advocates to key regulatory positions.

For now, the future of the U.S. Steel-Nippon Steel merger remains uncertain. Industry experts predict that the extended review period could lead to stricter conditions being imposed on the deal or even its outright rejection. Both companies have until the new deadline, set for March 31, 2025, to address regulatory concerns and make their case.

As the steel industry—and the nation—awaits a final decision, the outcome of this high-stakes merger could have lasting implications for global competition and the role of government in shaping the economy.

"Biden administration delays deadline for U.S. Steel, Nippon Steel to kill merger.

The Biden administration has given U.S. Steel and Japan’s Nippon Steel an extra six months to ditch their merger, keeping the deal alive as litigation unfolds over whether a national security panel’s review of it was tainted by political considerations.

Under the watch of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, the parties originally had 30 days to unwind the transaction following a Jan. 3 order from President Joe Biden.

“We are pleased that CFIUS has granted an extension to June 18, 2025, of the requirement in President Biden’s executive order that the parties permanently abandon the transaction,” the companies said in a joint statement. “We look forward to completing the transaction, which secures the best future for the American steel industry and all our stakeholders.”

The delay gives the companies time to argue a lawsuit filed Monday against the administration asking a federal appeals court to void Biden’s decision and force a new national security review.

An inconclusive report from the Treasury-led committee paved the way for Biden to axe the deal. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has defended the committee’s analysis as “thorough.”

An accompanying lawsuit accuses United Steelworkers International President David McCall and Cleveland-Cliffs CEO Lourenco Goncalves of conspiring to tank the deal for anti-competitive reasons, and seeks an injunction to stop further alleged tampering.

McCall and Goncalves have rejected the allegations and vowed to mount a vigorous defense.

Despite these glimmers of hope, Nippon’s nearly $15 billion takeover of the Pittsburgh-based manufacturer is likely on life support, legal and industry experts told TribLive. The courts may be hesitant to intervene, and, even if they do, the decision could fall to incoming President Donald Trump, who also opposes the deal.

After taking a stance last January, Trump has shown few signs of flip-flopping. The companies have courted him, nonetheless, perhaps banking on his fondness for undoing the work of his presidential predecessors.

“The president can step in now and undo the wrongful, shameful, corrupt actions of Biden,” U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said. “We understand what his current views are, but he’s a smart guy. He has the opportunity to have fresh eyes and do what’s right, and I believe strongly he will.”",https://triblive.com/local/regional/biden-administration-delays-deadline-for-u-s-steel-nippon-steel-to-kill-merger/,real,0
"Out-of-state company accused of not maintaining Pittsburgh apartments where fire killed 2-year-old.

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — In the wake of the tragic death of a 2-year-old girl in an apartment fire in Pittsburgh, KDKA Investigates has uncovered years of neglect by a company that owns dozens of complexes across the country, resulting in what Mayor Ed Gainey called ""horrible"" conditions. 

Now, the community and leaders are calling for accountability and change. 

Touring the Maple Ridge Apartments on Tuesday, Mayor Gainey heard the complaints from residents of rats and mice, no heat, falling plaster, and mold. These conditions came to light after a fatal fire on Dec. 27 that killed Praise Lemons.

""We've had a difficult time finding out who the ownership is,"" Gainey said on Tuesday. ""We know the name, but it's the principals that we've been trying to get in touch with.""

KDKA Investigates found the owner of the complex to be the Vitus Group, a Seattle-based company that owns 136 federally subsidized housing complexes across the country, drawing similar complaints of neglect. 

""These folks are just making money hand over fist, federal tax dollars, and not doing their part in ensuring the most vulnerable in our society have adequate, comfortable living conditions,"" Pittsburgh City Councilman Khari Mosley said. 

Vitus did not return phone calls or emails, but Councilman Mosley said it is one of several out-of-state real estate companies that take federal money and warehouse the poor. 

Earlier this year, KDKA reported on another real estate company, NB Affordable. It owns the complaint-ridden Homewood House apartment building. In October, District Attorney Stephen Zappala filed charges against NB for conditions at the Mon View Heights housing complex in West Mifflin.

""Getting federal tax dollars and providing just horrible, horrible conditions for the residents who live in their facilities,"" Mosley said. 

Vitus bought Maple Ridge in November 2022 promising to make major renovations, but residents said it has failed to make even minor repairs. Vitus employs a maintenance company, the New York-based MMS Group, which also did not return phone calls. Residents said the company is slow to respond to complaints. 

""They are essentially taking public dollars and they have a duty to maintain these properties,"" U.S. Rep. Summer Lee said. ""Everybody has a right to live in safe and sanitary housing.""

Congresswoman Lee said she is on the trail of private real estate companies and private equity firms that she says use federal funds to prey on the poor. She is crafting legislation and wants to strengthen the oversight of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which funds them. 

""We want to strengthen HUD,"" Lee said. ""Make sure HUD has the resources it needs to monitor this and to remedy it.""

While Councilman Mosley says the city will look at any and all options, Congresswoman Lee says this is a main priority of hers, to rein in these companies by demanding accountability and change.",https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/kdka-investigates-pittsburgh-apartments-neglect-conditions/,real,0
"Out-of-state company accused of not maintaining Pittsburgh apartments where fire killed 2-year-old.

An out-of-state property management company is facing accusations of neglect after a tragic fire claimed the life of a 2-year-old child in a Pittsburgh apartment complex. The incident has brought to light allegations of poor maintenance practices and raised questions about tenant safety.

The fire broke out in the early hours of Wednesday morning at the Maplewood Apartments in the city’s East Hills neighborhood. Firefighters arrived to find flames engulfing the third floor of one building. Although crews managed to contain the blaze within two hours, the loss of life has left the community reeling.

Preliminary investigations by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire suggest that the blaze originated in the kitchen of one unit, possibly due to an electrical fault. “Our initial findings point to aging wiring as a potential cause,” stated Deputy Fire Chief Mark Jacobs. “This complex was built in the 1970s, and it’s evident that the electrical systems have not been adequately updated.”

A scientific study conducted in 2022 by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) found that electrical faults account for nearly 13% of residential fires in the United States. Furthermore, older buildings—particularly those constructed before modern safety codes—are at higher risk if regular maintenance is not performed.

Residents of the Maplewood Apartments claim that complaints about maintenance issues, including faulty wiring and broken smoke detectors, have been repeatedly ignored. “I’ve lived here for three years, and every time we report something, it takes months to get a response—if we get one at all,” said tenant Maria Hernandez. “We’ve been asking for new smoke detectors since last summer.”

The property is managed by Westview Residential, a company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, which owns several similar complexes across the country. Attempts to reach the company for comment were unsuccessful, but a spokesperson issued a brief statement online, expressing condolences to the family of the victim and promising full cooperation with investigators.

Local officials are demanding accountability. City Councilmember Jordan Reed, whose district includes the Maplewood Apartments, has called for an independent inspection of all properties managed by Westview Residential in Pittsburgh. “It’s unacceptable that families are living in unsafe conditions,” Reed said. “This tragedy could have been prevented if the landlord had prioritized safety.”

Experts in fire prevention stress the importance of routine inspections and adherence to building codes. Dr. Eleanor Finch, a professor of urban planning at the University of Pittsburgh, emphasized that proactive measures can save lives. “Regular electrical inspections and the replacement of outdated systems are critical in reducing fire risks,” she explained. “Unfortunately, many property management companies neglect these responsibilities, particularly in low-income housing.”

As investigators continue to sift through the charred remains of the apartment, grieving family members are left searching for answers. Among them is Rachel Moore, the mother of the 2-year-old victim. “I trusted that we were safe here,” she said through tears. “No parent should have to bury their child because someone cut corners.”

Community groups are rallying to support affected families, with local nonprofit organizations organizing fundraisers and providing temporary housing. Meanwhile, tenant advocacy groups are pushing for stricter enforcement of housing regulations.

The tragedy has reignited a broader conversation about the responsibilities of property management companies and the need for systemic reform. As Pittsburgh mourns this devastating loss, the hope is that lessons learned from this incident will lead to safer housing for all.","Please create text for news article named ""Out-of-state company accused of not maintaining Pittsburgh apartments where fire killed 2-year-old"".

"Persimmons to Eat, Persimmons to Dye with.

It’s autumn, and the persimmons are ripe—and this is the only season of the year when you can eat them fresh. Take a trip to Hsinchu’s Xinpu Township, Taiwan’s largest producer of dried persimmons, and stop for a moment to appreciate the scenes of sunlight pouring through the fruit drying racks. Any photo you take will be beautiful, for at a moment like this every­one is a master photographer. But if you miss the season, don’t worry: You can visit the Xinpu Persimmon Dye House and make DIY prints of auspicious sayings featuring puns on the Chinese word for persimmon.

Each year the peak ripening and harvest season for persimmons runs roughly from September to December. According to statistics from the Council of Agriculture, the main persimmon growing areas in Taiwan are Dongshi in Taichung, Fanlu in Chiayi, Gongguan in Miaoli, Beinan in Taitung, and Beipu in Hsinchu.

Besides orange-colored “sweet persimmons” (tianshi), which are crispy and refreshing, and soft, juicy “water persimmons” (shuishi), there are also “astringent persimmons” (seshi), which have to be processed after harvesting to remove their astringent taste before they can be eaten. This last variety is mostly used for making dried persimmons (a.k.a. “persimmon cakes”). The hilly terrain and dry climate of the Hankeng neighborhood of Hsinchu County’s Xinpu Township make it ideally suited to sun-drying persimmons, and more than 80% of Taiwan’s dried persimmons are produced there. The golden-yellow “persimmon world” you can see in Xinpu is one of Taiwan’s most picturesque autumn scenes.

Simply delicious

Documentary evidence indicates that preserving persimmons by drying dates back at least 160 years in Hsinchu. Taking advantage of the powerful northeasterly monsoon winds that spring up in late October, local Hakka residents have long treated persimmons with the elements of sunlight, cold breezes, and time, to turn unbearably astringent fruits into sweet, soft and chewy persimmon cakes.

Lu Li-chien, owner of Weiweijia Persimmon Farm (Pro Persimmon), who has been making persimmon cakes for 40 years, says: “Persimmon dryers love cold fronts. Sometimes the northeasterly monsoon blows for a whole week, and we can rest easy at night. But we really worry about dew.”

Persimmon cakes made from the “stone persimmon” (shishi) variety are sweet with a chewy texture, while those made from the “bull heart” (niuxinshi) variety are large and fleshy. Many years ago Lu successfully adjusted the sun-­drying time and oven-drying temperature to dry the “pen persimmons” (bishi) harvested in Taichung’s Dongshi District each December. Epicures with a sweet tooth know that you have to wait until December for the sweet, soft, and chewy pen persimmon cakes to come on the market.

Specialized freezing technology is also used to dry persimmons. As the moisture slowly evaporates from the fruit, the sugars within it form a layer of white powder on the surface. This is natural “persimmon frost,” and the dried fruits can be combined with traditional Chinese medicines like wolfberry to make a chicken soup that can “clear heat and dissipate phlegm.”


Dried persimmons have diverse textures and degrees of sweetness, depending on the persimmon variety used. The persimmon cakes at right in the picture are made from those shown at left by further drying until their water content is around 30%. They can be combined with medicinal herbs to make a healthful soup.

Photographing the persimmon world

Although these days mobile phones have largely replaced cameras, many folks with high-end cameras are drawn to photograph the trays of golden-yellow persimmons during the drying period. Lu Li-chien doesn’t charge admission at his farm. He explains that many people who visit every year have become friends, and each year they call out to him and say, “Li-chien, another year has come.” Time may be relentless, but friendship is timeless.


Taking advantage of the monsoon winds of autumn, persimmons are set out in trays on racks to dry, creating a golden-yellow “persimmon world.”


Lu Li-chien sticks to the traditional method of sun-drying. The slow process of further ripening that takes place as the persimmons dry gives the best texture.

Dyeing with persimmons

In the past, fruit farmers used to compost leftover persimmons. But Lu I-cheng, fourth-generation heir to the Weiweijia Farm, worked with Hsuan Chuang University and a biotechnology company to extract tannins from the flesh and skin of fallen fruit to make products including shampoo and cosmetics, thus getting better economic value out of the entire fruit. This has added a new aspect to the family tradition of growing persimmons.

Persimmon juice is rich in tannins and pectin, and can also be used to make dye. In 2010 the Xinpu Township Office wanted to copy the success of Sanxia’s indigo dye and develop persimmon dye as a distinctive local product. The dye, made from fallen or blemished persimmons purchased from fruit farmers, expresses the frugal Hakka spirit of making optimal use of all things.

The township office also guided the founding of the Xinpu Persimmon Dye House, where the cloth dyeing area gives off the astringent aroma of fermenting persimmon juice. Dye House secretary Chung Meng-chuan notes that after a year or two of oxidation, the color of the juice becomes more intense. Through various persimmon dyeing techniques, cloth takes on earth tones like brown and gray-black, with a strong designer aesthetic. People buy face cloths, cup cozies, or bags, and then do DIY persimmon dyeing, making great souvenirs of their visit to Xinpu.",https://www.taiwan-panorama.com/en/Articles/Details?Guid=d634b27b-c214-4c8b-925c-4801629bd825&CatId=6&postname=Persimmons%20to%20Eat%2C%20%20Persimmons%20to%20Dye%20with-A%20Visit%20to%20Persimmon%20Country,real,0
"Persimmons to Eat, Persimmons to Dye with.

Persimmons, the orange-hued fruits of autumn, are making a splash this winter not only on the dinner table but also in the world of sustainable fashion and crafting. With their sweet, tangy flavor and unexpected versatility as a natural dye, persimmons are having their moment in the spotlight.

A Culinary Delight

Persimmons come in two main varieties: the astringent Hachiya and the non-astringent Fuyu. Hachiyas, with their deep orange, acorn-like shape, are best eaten when fully ripe and almost jelly-like. Meanwhile, Fuyus, resembling squat tomatoes, can be eaten while still firm, making them a versatile addition to salads, baked goods, and even savory dishes.

Chefs and food enthusiasts are finding creative ways to incorporate persimmons into their menus. Persimmon puddings, jams, and cocktails are trending in restaurants across the country. ""The natural sweetness of persimmons pairs beautifully with spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom,"" says chef Elena Green, owner of Farm to Table Feast in San Francisco. ""They're the perfect fruit to transition from autumn to winter.""

A Natural Dye Revolution

Beyond the culinary world, persimmons are gaining attention as a sustainable and eco-friendly dye source. Traditional dyeing methods in Japan, known as kakishibu, involve using unripe persimmons to create a vibrant, earthy orange hue. The dye, rich in tannins, is valued for its water-resistant and antimicrobial properties.

""Persimmon dye is not just about aesthetics,"" explains textile artist Hiro Tanaka. ""It's also about connecting with nature and history. The dyeing process is slow and deliberate, reminding us of the beauty in patience and craftsmanship.""

Artisans and small-scale textile producers are now reviving this ancient practice, incorporating persimmon-dyed fabrics into modern designs. From scarves and tote bags to hand-dyed linens, these creations are finding a niche market among environmentally conscious consumers.

The Future of Persimmons

As interest in natural and sustainable products grows, persimmons are poised to become a key player in both the food and fashion industries. Farmers are reporting increased demand, not just for ripe fruit but also for unripe ones used in dye production. Some agricultural cooperatives are even collaborating with textile producers to ensure a steady supply.

Whether you prefer them on your plate or as part of your wardrobe, persimmons are proving to be as versatile as they are beautiful. Their dual appeal is a testament to the creative ways we can utilize nature's bounty—one persimmon at a time.

How to Try It Yourself

For the curious, persimmons are widely available at farmers' markets and grocery stores during their peak season from late fall to early winter. Dye enthusiasts can experiment at home by mashing unripe persimmons, straining the liquid, and applying it to natural fabrics like cotton or silk. Be sure to research proper dye-setting techniques to ensure lasting results.

"Carlo Ancelotti 'sad and disappointed' after Real Madrid humbling.

Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti expressed his deep disappointment following his team’s humbling defeat in a recent high-stakes match. The Italian tactician, known for his calm demeanor, did not shy away from acknowledging the shortcomings of his squad, describing the performance as below the standard expected of a club with Real Madrid’s stature.

A Tough Night for Los Blancos

The match, which saw Real Madrid suffer a heavy loss, left fans and pundits alike questioning the team's strategy and cohesion. Ancelotti admitted that the night was a sobering experience for everyone involved. ""It’s a result that hurts. I’m sad and disappointed because we didn’t meet the expectations,"" he stated during the post-match press conference.

While he refrained from pointing fingers at individual players, Ancelotti acknowledged that there were tactical missteps and a lack of intensity that contributed to the defeat. ""We were not sharp enough in key moments, and our structure fell apart under pressure,"" he added.

Defensive Fragility and Midfield Struggles

One of the glaring issues was Real Madrid’s defensive vulnerabilities. Despite the presence of experienced defenders, the backline appeared disorganized, allowing the opposition to capitalize on several opportunities. Additionally, the midfield struggled to assert control, failing to provide adequate support to the defense or create meaningful chances for the forwards.

Ancelotti also highlighted the lack of urgency and focus in the team’s approach. ""When you play for Real Madrid, you carry the responsibility of the badge. Tonight, we didn’t show the character and determination that are synonymous with this club,"" he remarked.

A Call for Reflection

In his typically measured style, Ancelotti emphasized the need for the team to regroup and learn from the experience. ""This is a wake-up call. We have to analyze what went wrong and work harder to ensure we bounce back,"" he said. The manager also reassured fans that the squad remains united and committed to improving.

Looking Ahead

With several crucial matches looming, the focus now shifts to how Real Madrid can recover from this setback. Ancelotti’s vast experience and calm leadership will undoubtedly be pivotal in guiding the team forward. ""There’s no time to dwell on the past. We must look ahead and respond in the best possible way,"" he concluded.

While this defeat may serve as a painful reminder of the challenges in maintaining consistency at the highest level, it also presents an opportunity for the team to demonstrate resilience and character—qualities that have long been the hallmark of Real Madrid under Ancelotti’s stewardship.","Create an article about the given title: """"""Carlo Ancelotti 'sad and disappointed' after Real Madrid humbling""""""",fake,1
"Carlo Ancelotti 'sad and disappointed' after Real Madrid humbling.

Carlo Ancelotti said he was ""sad and disappointed"" after Real Madrid's 5-2 Supercopa final defeat to Barcelona in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on Sunday, while admitting his team ""didn't defend well.""

Kylian Mbappé put Madrid ahead in the fifth minute before Lamine Yamal levelled and goals from Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha and Alejandro Balde put Barça 4-1 up at half-time. Raphinha added a fifth goal after the break before goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was sent off, and Rodrygo pulled a goal back for Madrid.

The result was a boost for Barcelona and coach Hansi Flick after their league form had slumped in recent weeks, and a blow for Madrid, who missed out on what would have been their third trophy this season.

""We have to look at the reality. We didn't defend well,"" a deflated Ancelotti said in his post-match news conference. ""We tried to press high and defend with a low block. They scored the goals easily, and we didn't work hard, collectively or individually.

""We lost a lot of duels. That makes us sad and disappointed, but that's football. We have to take that sadness home. I understand the sadness of our fans. We feel that, but we have to look forward, and prepare for the next game, and recover the good form we'd been in.""

"Grassroots reflect pelagic fishery talent plight hinders industry development.

Last year, the city's total output of pelagic fisheries reached 41 billion yuan, “the first city of the national pelagic fisheries,” the construction of effective, but with the expansion of the industry, the shortage of pelagic fishery talent gradually highlighted. First, the backbone of the talent training is slow, there is a gap. As the backbone of the industry, the aging of the crew is serious and slow training, the city is currently more than 50 years of age offshore fishing crew accounted for more than 70%, more than 60 years old than 20%, every year a large number of crew retired no longer engaged in the production. Captains, chief engineers and other senior positions in the average training time of nearly 10 years, it is difficult to quickly make up for the shortfall, resulting in a gap in talent. Secondly, the ordinary crew lack of specialization, poor adaptability. More than half of the city's offshore fishing crew from the inland areas, there is often a lack of professionalism, lack of experience in marine operations and the face of the hard sea life and heavy physical labor psychological preparedness, poor adaptability and other issues, and in serious cases even appeared to force the ship to return to the situation, resulting in the city's offshore fishing vessels default return rate of 10% to 15% for a long period of time. Shandong an ocean-going squid fishing vessel operating in the southwest Pacific Ocean, has occurred due to inland crew labor conflicts, not adapted to the sea life and other factors triggered a major criminal case of extreme cases. Third, the outflow of foreign crew resources and management difficulties. Affected by the new crown infection epidemic, our country since the beginning of 2020 prohibited foreign crew members to enter the country, has not yet resumed, foreign crew can only through a third country “outside into the outside”, increasing management uncertainty. The city's existing more than 2,000 foreign crew, Indonesia accounted for about 78.1%, the Philippines accounted for about 21.4%, the complexity of the origin of the personnel, the background of the unknown, outside of the ship on and off the procedures are cumbersome, the management of greater pressure. In addition, foreign crew members are mainly recruited through intermediary organizations, and the intermediary draws a high commission, so the actual monthly salary of crew members is only 350 to 400 U.S. dollars, which is an obvious gap with domestic crew members. According to public information, China's Taiwan fishing boat foreign crew minimum monthly salary of 550 U.S. dollars, South Korea's fishing boat foreign crew minimum monthly salary of 90% of the national crew, compared to which the city's attraction to foreign crew is limited. To this end, it is recommended that: the establishment of special support funds for the cultivation of offshore fishing personnel, encourage the development of school-enterprise cooperation, and improve the talent cultivation system; to broaden the recruitment channels for crew members, strengthen the standardization of intermediary management, and actively explore the potential of the domestic labor force in the central and western regions of China and Southeast Asian countries.",http://news.cjn.cn/zjjjdpd/zs/202404/t4873414.htm,real,0
"Grassroots reflect pelagic fishery talent plight hinders industry development.

The global pelagic fishery industry, which revolves around the capture and management of fish living in the upper layers of the open ocean, is facing a critical challenge: a shortage of skilled talent. Experts and grassroots stakeholders have raised concerns that this issue is significantly impeding the industry's ability to adapt to emerging challenges and opportunities.

Talent Shortages: A Deepening Crisis

From small-scale fishing communities to larger enterprises, the lack of trained professionals is evident at every level of the pelagic fishery sector. Industry veterans cite declining enrollment in specialized training programs, insufficient investment in educational initiatives, and limited access to modern technology as key contributors to the talent drought.

Local fisherfolk report that younger generations are increasingly turning away from traditional fishing trades in favor of more lucrative or urban-based career paths. ""Our children don’t see a future in fishing anymore,"" says Maria Gomez, a second-generation fisherwoman from Peru. ""They say it’s too risky, with no stability or support.""

Challenges to Growth and Sustainability

The implications of this talent gap extend beyond recruitment difficulties. Industry insiders highlight that the lack of qualified professionals hinders the adoption of sustainable fishing practices, limits the ability to navigate complex regulatory frameworks, and stifles innovation in areas such as digital monitoring and fish stock assessment.

""The pelagic fishery industry is uniquely positioned to contribute to food security and economic growth,"" explains Dr. Nathan Collier, a marine economist. ""But without skilled talent, we're unable to fully utilize advanced techniques like satellite tracking of fish migrations or artificial intelligence for ecosystem modeling.""

Grassroots Voices Call for Action

Grassroots organizations have been vocal in their calls for targeted interventions to address these challenges. Many argue that industry leaders and policymakers need to prioritize community-based training programs and financial support for aspiring fishery workers.

""We need scholarships, apprenticeship programs, and outreach initiatives to inspire the next generation,"" says Ibrahim Farouk, a community leader from Senegal. ""If we don’t invest in people, our waters will be mismanaged, and our livelihoods will suffer.""

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and local cooperatives have also stepped up to fill the void. Several grassroots projects are focusing on empowering women and youth to enter the pelagic fishery sector by offering technical training and access to resources. However, these efforts often lack scalability due to limited funding and governmental support.

A Path Forward

Industry stakeholders are advocating for multi-pronged solutions to the talent crisis. Recommendations include:

Investment in Education and Training: Establishing specialized schools and certification programs tailored to pelagic fisheries.

Incentivizing Careers in Fishing: Offering financial incentives, such as tax breaks or subsidies, to encourage young people to join the sector.

Technology Transfer: Making advanced tools and equipment accessible to grassroots communities to modernize fishing practices.

Public-Private Partnerships: Engaging both governmental bodies and private entities in funding and implementing sustainable solutions.

Conclusion

The plight of talent shortages in the pelagic fishery sector reflects a broader challenge for global industries that rely heavily on specialized skills. Addressing this issue requires collaborative efforts across local, national, and international levels. By investing in human capital and sustainable practices, the pelagic fishery industry can ensure its growth while safeguarding the livelihoods of millions dependent on it.

For now, grassroots voices continue to echo a common refrain: without immediate action, the industry risks stagnation, and the oceans’ potential to support humanity’s future will remain untapped.",please generate a news article with the title of Grassroots reflect pelagic fishery talent plight hinders industry development.,fake,1

"80-year-old Pardeeville man found guilty of staging longtime girlfriend's death.

PORTAGE, Wis. (WKOW) -- A Columbia County jury found a Pardeeville man guilty of first-degree intentional homicide in his longtime girlfriend's death. 

A judge convicted Larry Manthe, 80, in the 2022 death of Alice Langer, 76, after the jury deliberated for a total of nearly 14 hours on Thursday and Friday. 

The trial lasted for five days, including deliberations. 

Langer was found on Oct. 6, 2022 in the shower of the home where she and Manthe lived with a handgun on her lap and a gunshot wound to the left side of her head.

Her death was originally ruled a suicide until the medical examiner said the gunpowder burns on her body discovered during the autopsy was not normally seen in suicides. 

Prosecutors argued Manthe staged Langer's death. His DNA was found on the gun and ammunition. 

A first-degree intentional homicide conviction comes with an automatic life in prison sentence in the state of Wisconsin. A judge will decide at sentencing if Manthe will ever be eligible to apply for extended supervision.

"80-year-old Pardeeville man found guilty of staging longtime girlfriend's death.

Pardeeville, WI – In a case that has gripped the small Wisconsin town of Pardeeville and drawn national attention, an 80-year-old man was found guilty on Friday of staging his longtime girlfriend’s death to look like an accident.

The verdict, delivered by a Columbia County jury after two weeks of emotional testimony and forensic evidence, brings an end to a tragic case that began nearly a year ago when the lifeless body of 76-year-old Dorothy “Dot” Mills was discovered at the bottom of her basement stairs.

**A Suspicious Scene**

Authorities were called to Mills’ home on January 14th, 2024, after her partner of 30 years, Henry Barlow, reported finding her unresponsive. Barlow told first responders that Mills had likely tripped over a loose rug, causing her to fall down the stairs. Initially, the scene appeared consistent with an accidental fall.

However, an autopsy raised questions. The medical examiner determined that Mills had sustained injuries inconsistent with a simple fall, including blunt force trauma to the back of her head and defensive wounds on her hands and arms. The examiner also noted bruising patterns on Mills’ wrists, suggesting she may have been restrained.

Detectives began to scrutinize Barlow’s account of events. Their investigation uncovered inconsistencies in his timeline and behavior that cast doubt on his claims. Surveillance footage from a nearby neighbor’s security camera revealed no visitors to the home on the night of Mills’ death, contradicting Barlow’s earlier suggestion that an unknown intruder might have been involved.

**Financial Motive Uncovered**

During the trial, prosecutors argued that Barlow staged Mills’ death to appear accidental as part of a scheme to inherit her substantial life savings and property. Evidence presented in court showed that Barlow had recently convinced Mills to revise her will, naming him as the primary beneficiary.

Assistant District Attorney Laura Nichols described Barlow as a man motivated by greed and desperation. “This was not the act of a grieving partner,” Nichols said in her closing arguments. “This was a calculated and cruel attempt to cover up a heinous crime.”

Barlow’s defense attorney, James Whitaker, maintained his client’s innocence, claiming that Mills’ death was indeed a tragic accident. “Henry Barlow loved Dorothy Mills,” Whitaker said. “He had no reason to harm her.”

**Key Evidence and Testimony**

The jury heard from a range of witnesses, including forensic experts, neighbors, and close friends of Mills. Among the most damning pieces of evidence was a hammer found in Barlow’s garage, which forensic analysts testified matched the pattern of Mills’ head injury. Traces of her blood were found on the tool.

The prosecution also presented text messages and emails between Barlow and Mills in the weeks leading up to her death. In the messages, Mills expressed concerns about Barlow’s erratic behavior and mentioned feeling unsafe.

The turning point in the trial came when a former friend of Barlow testified that he had confided in her about financial struggles and hinted at plans to “secure his future.” The friend’s testimony painted a chilling picture of premeditation.

**A Community in Shock**

Mills, a retired schoolteacher, was described by friends and family as kind, generous, and deeply loved in the Pardeeville community. Her sudden death and the revelations surrounding it have left many in shock.

“It’s hard to believe,” said Mary Jensen, a longtime friend of Mills. “Dot was the kind of person who would give you the shirt off her back. For her life to end this way, it’s heartbreaking.”

Barlow, who appeared stoic as the verdict was read, now faces a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole. Sentencing is scheduled for next month.

**Seeking Justice**

Speaking after the trial, Mills’ niece, Jennifer Harris, said the family is relieved by the verdict but remains devastated by the loss. “We trusted Henry,” she said. “To know that someone so close to her could do something so horrific—it’s something we’ll never fully understand.”

Harris also expressed gratitude to law enforcement and the legal team that worked tirelessly on the case. “Dorothy deserved justice, and today, we got it.”

As Pardeeville comes to terms with the tragedy, many hope that Mills’ story will serve as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and community support in protecting the most vulnerable.","Generate a news article with the given news title that is as real as possible.

"Planning Board Hears Preliminary Plan for 1414 Mass Ave Development and Presentation on Traffic Study.

(10-JAN-25) At its virtual meeting on Monday January 6, the Boxborough Planning Board worked through a packed agenda that included hearing a preliminary plan for the development of approximately  213 acres at 1414 Mass Ave; a first draft presentation on the comprehensive traffic study conducted by consultant Green International Affiliates; and continued public hearings on site plan approval for 340 Codman Hill Road and a proposed zoning bylaw amendment.

  

Over 20 attendees from both Boxborough and Harvard joined the meeting to hear a presentation from Dante Angelucci, Senior Vice President of Development and Construction for the Lincoln Property Company.

  

Prior to Angelucci’s presentation, Planning Board Chair Mark White clarified for the audience that “this is…not yet a formal application…. It’s just a preliminary, conceptual plan, and our job right now is to…listen and try to understand exactly what they would like to do…and what they actually can do.”

  

Angelucci presented three conceptual plans for the development of parcels collectively known as 1414 Mass Ave. The property has frontage on the south side of Mass Ave, between Adams Place and the west end of Burroughs Road and extends south to the solar farm, abutting the Regency Hotel to the west and the Wolf Swamp conservation area to the east. All of the parcels are zoned for “Office Park.” (See map). 

  

Option 1 showed one 100,000 square foot building for “light manufacturing” use at the front of the property (Mass Ave), and the plan labeled the remaining parcels as “future development.” Light manufacturing use is permitted “by right” in the Office Park zone. 

  

Option 2 showed a full build-out of three buildings, also for light manufacturing, that would total 592,875 square feet and use a large percentage of the acreage. 

  

Option 3 showed three warehouse buildings, one fronting Mass Ave and two others in the southern part of the property, and left 120 acres as “open space.” Chair White informed Angelucci that warehouses are not permitted in the Office Park zone. If Lincoln Property Company were to pursue this plan, a zoning bylaw change would be needed. Zoning bylaw changes require a two thirds vote of Town Meeting.  

  

Members of the board and the public asked questions regarding the marketability of “light manufacturing” space and commented on the high number of parking spaces shown in the plan. Chair White asked Angelucci to meet with the board and public again in an informal mode to share additional information regarding engineering and traffic calculations, as well as answer additional questions and hear input from the board and residents. No future meeting date was set.

  

In other matters, the board heard a report from Julianne Griffiths, a transportation planner from Green International Affiliates (“Green”), the consulting firm hired to conduct a comprehensive traffic study for the Route 111 corridor. The study evaluated existing and projected future traffic conditions based on proposed developments that would impact Route 111 and targeted intersections. Griffiths presented alternatives for traffic flow, which would alleviate wait times and improve safety at each of the intersections studied.

  

General recommendations for Route 111 improvements include coordinating with developers to fund improvements that would alleviate the impact of any potential development to the proximate intersection; widening Route 111 to install a bike lane along the corridor; and maintaining roadside vegetation to improve sight lines and enhance safety. 

  

Next steps for the town are to provide feedback to Green on the suggested alternatives. Green will then provide updated construction cost estimates and a summary of any permitting required. Green will produce a report with their final recommendations for all of the intersections studied. Members of the public are encouraged to watch the presentation (starting at 1:29:45) on BXB-TV (https://tinyurl.com/BoxPlanBd010625) and provide feedback to Town Planner Alec Wade (awade@boxborough-ma.gov). The complete traffic study can be downloaded from https://tinyurl.com/BoxTrafficStudy

  

The board also reopened and continued two public hearings. The first was to review the site plan application submitted by Bruce Saluk & Associates, Inc. on behalf of the applicant, Astro Crane, to construct two single-story industrial storage buildings at 340 Codman Hill Road. Several questions remain regarding parking spaces, truck turning radii, landscaping, and wells. The hearing was continued to February 3 at 7:05 p.m.

  

The second public hearing was a continuation of proposed zoning bylaw changes to “correct mislabeled footnotes, make grammatical corrections, and clean up misdirecting sections that no longer correlate.” The board continued the hearing until January 27, when they expect to vote on the final language of the proposed bylaw, which will be placed on the special town meeting (March 18) warrant. 

  

The next meeting of the Planning Board is scheduled for January 27. Aside from a vote on the proposed zoning bylaw amendment to correct and clean up various sections, the board will conduct a working session focused exclusively on Mass Ave zoning.",https://www.boxboroughnews.org/news,real,0

Spacious patios, complete with retractable awnings and outdoor kitchens, have become a favorite for those who enjoy al fresco dining under the stars. Full-size refrigerators, previously reserved for traditional homes, now ensure that travelers can stock up on groceries and gourmet essentials for long trips.

One of the most surprising additions is the inclusion of garages. These built-in spaces can house motorcycles, ATVs, or even compact cars, making it easier for RV owners to explore off-road trails or city streets without moving their entire vehicle.

Why the Upgrade?
Experts point to a growing trend in “van life” and remote work as driving forces behind this evolution. The COVID-19 pandemic spurred a renewed interest in RV travel, as families sought safer ways to explore. In addition, the rise of digital nomadism has created demand for mobile spaces that double as both homes and offices.

“RVers today want more than just a bed and a stove. They’re looking for a lifestyle,” said Laura Thompson, a spokesperson for the National RV Dealers Association. “The industry has had to innovate to meet the demand for high-end amenities and smarter layouts.”

The Price of Comfort
Luxury doesn’t come cheap. High-end RVs with these features can cost upwards of $500,000, with some models breaking the million-dollar mark. For those not ready to commit to ownership, rental platforms like Outdoorsy and RVshare have made it possible to enjoy these rolling mansions for a fraction of the cost.

The Future of RVs
As technology continues to evolve, the future of RVs looks even brighter. Solar panels, smart home systems, and eco-friendly materials are becoming standard. Some manufacturers are even exploring self-driving technology, which could allow RV owners to relax while their vehicle handles the driving.

With patios for entertaining, full-size appliances, and garages for added mobility, RVs are no longer just about getting from point A to point B. They’ve become destinations in themselves, offering an unparalleled way to travel in style and comfort.

For adventure enthusiasts, the message is clear: The open road has never looked so good.","generate a news article which has the following title RVs getting more elaborate, with patios, full-size fridges, and even garages",fake,1
"RVs getting more elaborate, with patios, full-size fridges, and even garages.

At the start of the pandemic, Adriana and Ken Fedunok’s daughter decided to join the RV craze, spurred by newfound flexibility found in work and home life.

They playfully teased her, saying, “Oh, we’ll get one and park it right next to yours,” expecting some pushback. Instead, she enthusiastically supported the idea.

Soon after, they purchased a camper from a friend and dove headfirst into the lifestyle.

“When you go up to camp, it’s like you’re on vacation all the time,” said Mr. Fedunok. “Our neighbors ask and say, ‘You still live here?’ ”

Now they plan to sell their home in North Strabane and embrace recreational vehicle living full time after retirement. That’s what brought them to the Pittsburgh RV Show on Saturday, where they could explore the latest models and think about what they want their future home to look like.

One model, featuring a king-size bed, garage, fireplace and 55-inch LED TV, caught their eye.

“We hope when we retire, they’re still making that design,” Ms. Fedunok said.

The Pittsburgh RV Show, the nation’s longest-running indoor RV exhibition, transforms the 350,000-square-foot David L. Lawrence Convention Center into a haven for RV enthusiasts. It continues through Jan. 19.

With over 150 models on display, options range from modest $25,000 travel trailers to luxurious motorhomes costing more than $300,000. The event draws 25,000 attendees annually, said show promoter and organizer Randy Giancola.

The pandemic fueled an RV boom as Americans embraced remote work and a more nomadic lifestyle. RVs also offer an alternative to costly hotels and the unpredictability of air travel. “I’ve never heard of an RV trip being delayed,” Mr. Giancola said.

Sales are normalizing back to pre-COVID times, with RV shipments dropping by nearly 92% from 2021 to 2023. But that doesn’t mean Americans don’t still love camping.

Today’s buyers want more than vehicles — they want homes on wheels, said Mr. Giancola, who sold his RV dealerships in 2015. He’s noticed that the tech and amenities in recent models now mirror comforts found in a standard house.

“It’s amazing — when I was in business, there wasn’t one unit that had a residential-style fridge,” he said. “You go in a lot of the bigger fifth wheels and the motor homes, I mean, you’re gonna see GE home-style fridges.”

And he said the demographics of those seeking out the vehicles are evolving too. He said he sees significantly more families at the shows compared to the boomer crowd of the past.

As self-described “big hikers” and “outdoorsy people,” Courtney and Kodie Claypoole headed to the show along with their 2-year-old son, Cooper, with hopes of upgrading their current camper. A grueling road trip to Florida made the North Side couple desperate for more space.

“We want to go from a camper to the RV, because there’s a little more freedom to move about, and he’s not sitting in a car seat for 20 hours,” Ms. Claypoole said.

The couple said they appreciated the opportunity to browse without the sales pressure felt at dealerships. Their son had simpler priorities, playing with all the steering wheels.

“We love coming to this event to just learn more about exactly what we want,” she said. “I want to just see stuff without being pitched.”

Of course, they had to browse the luxury options, too, some of which featured second-story lofts. “We like to go look at the fantasy ones. Like, yeah, we’re not gonna do that, but they’re pretty cool.”

Longtime RV enthusiast Kim Volpe was eyeing one model that featured a large outdoor patio. But her husband, Emmett, felt it was a bit out of their price range.

“You could put ours inside that thing,” he said.

Just in the past few years, RVing costs have risen significantly, from $1,100 to $2,400 in annual fees to stay at campgrounds, the couple said. “It used to be cheap to go camping. Now it’s pretty elaborate,” Mr. Volpe said.

For many, indeed, RV shopping is about balancing aspiration with practicality. Mike and Tiffany Christie want to sell their camper to possibly upgrade to a larger toy hauler. Their son, Nick, and his wife, Bethany, are looking to start small.

“We’re starting from scratch. We almost need the cheaper one, kind of like a starter home,” Nick Christie said.

And seeing the models in person has been much more fruitful than online shopping. “You can only Google so much,” he said, adding that he might be willing to buy today if he saw a good enough deal.

For some, the social side of RVing is what makes the investment worth it. That’s the case for Mike and Christina Stewart, who said the campsite they stay at each summer, Vacation Land in Sandy Lake, Pa., feels much different than what its name implies.

“You build this community,” she said. “You just go outside, and it’s like back in the day, you have your block of neighborhood kids. My kids have ’80s-style summers.”",https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2025/01/11/rvs-recreational-vehicle-elaborate-updates/stories/202501110055,real,0

"Portland Rock Gym in Beaverton aims for fitness, rock climbing mastery.

Indoor rock climbing is gaining popularity, and at Portland Rock Gym in Beaverton, you’ll not only be able to master your climbing skills, but you can also take part in fitness and yoga options.

Over the past several months, Portland Rock Gym has been opening in phases, but is now fully operational and gaining more members.

“It is an ever-growing sport,” Gym Manager Aaron Johnson said. “Being in the last two Olympic cycles has really helped, honestly. We’ve seen a large growth from that, and there are new gyms popping up across the country all the time.”

The facility offers bouldering, rock climbing and a full fitness area that offers weights, cardio equipment and two yoga studios.

Johnson says the facility opened in three phases at the Beaverton location. The first phase opened in September 2023, with bouldering, fitness and yoga. The second part of the project opened in March 2024, with locker rooms, showers and saunas. The final third opened Nov. 16, 2024, which included the Ropes Hall.

Portland Rock Gym in Beaverton is the largest facility of its kind in the Pacific Northwest, and perhaps the country, at 64,000 square feet. There, climbing walls range in size from 40 feet to 55 feet.

“With that, we also have our bouldering walls,” Johnson said. “Your tallest boulder here is 15 feet. Bouldering is different from top rope or lead climbing: It doesn’t require a belayer. The padded mats below soften any falls you may have.”

A belay helps control a rope that secures climbers.

“When you think about climbing, everybody thinks about arm strength and back strength,” he said. “But honestly, your core and your legs are just as important. That is the powerhouse of your body. The more you’re able to use those muscles, the better. Your balance has to improve with all that as well.”

Johnson says several age groups enjoy indoor rock climbing.

“Our baseline is they have to be able to wear climbing shoes and fit into the proper safety equipment,” he said. “I’ve had, probably, 5-year-olds in the gym, having a good time. With that, my programming all starts at age nine.”

And at Portland Rock Gym, rock climbing isn’t the only option.

“People can climb here, but we also have two yoga studios,” Johnson said. “We have fitness classes and with those we also have personal training options as well. I have a bunch of members who don’t climb and are not interested in climbing. They just come in for the fitness side.”

Portland Rock Gym opened its Northeast Portland facility in 1988, making it the second rock-climbing gym in the United States. And now its Beaverton location is gaining in popularity. 

“We have had a great response,” Johnson said. “The chamber of commerce has come out a few times. The mayor’s been out. Explore Tualatin Valley has done some stuff with us. On top of that, I’ve had a couple of schools reach out and are participating with us on some things.”

Johnson added, “Beaverton, as a whole, has been really welcoming and a great partner to us.”

Memberships to Portland Rock Gym come in a variety of options.

“I have monthly memberships, yearly memberships, family memberships, couple’s memberships,” he said. “There are a lot of options to get into the gym.”

Portland Rock Gym in Beaverton is located at 10860 S.W. Barnes Road at the Peterkort Towne Square.",https://www.beavertonvalleytimes.com/news/portland-rock-gym-in-beaverton-aims-for-fitness-rock-climbing-mastery/article_2b487364-ced1-11ef-b48a-471d76dc18fb.html,real,0
