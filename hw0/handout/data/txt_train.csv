"Edison Public Library To Close Jan. 13 For Asbestos Removal, Renovations.

Edison, NJ – The Edison Public Library will temporarily close its doors starting Saturday, January 13, to address long-overdue maintenance issues, including the removal of asbestos and major facility renovations. The closure is expected to last several months, with the library planning to reopen by mid-summer.

The decision comes after a routine inspection revealed the presence of asbestos in the building’s older infrastructure. While officials stressed that there is no immediate health risk to patrons or staff, the library board voted unanimously to take proactive measures to ensure the safety of all who use the facility.

“The health and well-being of our community are our top priorities,” said Library Director Jane Martinez. “While this closure is inconvenient, it is necessary to provide a safe and modern space for everyone.”

In addition to asbestos abatement, the library will undergo extensive renovations aimed at modernizing the 40-year-old building. Planned upgrades include a revamped children’s section, additional study rooms, enhanced technology services, and improved accessibility features, such as elevators and wider doorways.

During the closure, library services will not come to a halt. A temporary pop-up location will operate out of the Edison Municipal Center on Municipal Boulevard, offering limited book lending, computer access, and children’s programs. Additionally, patrons will have expanded access to digital resources, including e-books, audiobooks, and online databases. The library’s popular curbside pickup service will also continue at the temporary location.

Local residents expressed mixed feelings about the closure. “It’s a shame because the library is such an important resource for the community,” said longtime patron Sandra Lee. “But I’m glad they’re prioritizing safety and making improvements.”

Funding for the project comes from a combination of local government allocations and a state grant for public infrastructure improvements. The total cost of the renovations is estimated at $3.2 million.

Library officials encourage residents to stay updated on the progress of the project through their website and social media channels. “We’re committed to keeping the community informed every step of the way,” Martinez said.

For now, Edison residents are urged to make use of nearby libraries in Metuchen and Woodbridge, which have offered reciprocal borrowing privileges during the closure.

“We’re excited about what the future holds for the Edison Public Library,” Martinez added. “When we reopen, it will be a space that truly reflects the needs and aspirations of our community.”

"Edison Public Library To Close Jan. 13 For Asbestos Removal, Renovations.

EDISON, NJ - The Edison Public Library will begin the second phase of asbestos removal and renovations at its Plainfield Avenue location next week.

Work on the lower level of the Main Library is expected to start in the coming weeks. In an effort to prepare for the work, the building will be closed for around two weeks, beginning Monday, Jan. 13.

This closure will provide Edison Public Library staff the opportunity to relocate materials, shelvings, computers, and more from the lower level to the newly renovated upper level.

Additionally, the Main Library is expected to remain closed to both patrons and staff through Feb. 9 in order to perform asbestos removal on the lower level.

“At this time, we anticipate welcoming both staff and patrons back inside the building on Monday Feb. 10 and remain committed to keeping the community informed should there be any delays or changes over the coming weeks,” Allan Kleiman, director of the Edison Public Library, said in a statement.

“Once we reopen, all services will be contained to the Upper Level only as work to renovate the Lower Level begins.”

During the closure, the book drop at the Main Library will be closed. Materials can be returned to the North Edison and Clara Barton Branches and the Bookmobiles, which will maintain all regular schedules and operating hours over the coming weeks.

The North Edison and Clara Barton Branches remain open Monday through Thursday from 9:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Friday and Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.

Additionally, while the Main Library is closed, the North Edison Branch will be open on Sunday, Jan. 19, Sunday Jan. 26, Sunday, Feb. 2, and Sunday, Feb. 9 from noon to 5 p.m.

Patrons can also access services at any of the January Bookmobile stops as well as through the Edison Public Library's digital resources, which remain available at all times. Patrons are also able to visit neighboring libraries such as Highland Park, Metuchen, Piscataway, and South Plainfield.

Holds at Main will be available for pick up through Sunday, Jan. 12; during the closure, patrons will only be able to place holds for pick up at the Clara Barton and North Edison locations or the Bookmobile.

"Climate change will continue with warmer, wetter conditions predicted.

Jim Bonner used to associate mockingbirds with the southern part of the United States.

His backyard is home to one, it’s indicative of how weather changes have impacted the avian species, and likely will continue for other types of birds.

“I see more mockingbirds now that I ever did 20 years ago,” said Bonner, executive director of the Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania. “Their range has continued to expand northward.”

Birds that make their homes in backyards across the region are likely to be affected by the ongoing warming of the planet as a result of climate change. On Friday, several weather monitoring agencies announced 2024 was Earth’s hottest year ever, the Associated Press reported.

The National Weather Service in Moon reported this month that 2024 was the warmest year on record for the Pittsburgh region with an average mean temperature of 56.4 degrees The previous record was set in 1921 at 55.4 degrees.

Over the next 25 years, climate change is predicted to affect many aspects of daily life for Pennsylvanians. Among those predictions are:

• It’s going to be warmer — the average temperature in Pennsylvania is expected to increase by nearly 6 degrees by 2050 and the number of 90-degree days will rise, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection’s Climate Impacts Assessment for 2021. Heat waves are expected to become increasingly common and the time of year when weather can be warm may bleed into spring and fall, reducing the amount of time without frost, according to Community Climate Outlook assessments spearheaded by a partnership led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

By 2070, Westmoreland County could see an average of 10 to 24 days above 95 degrees, while Allegheny County could expect 13 to 30 days above that benchmark per year, according to the assessments.

• It’s going to be wetter — the average annual precipitation could increase by 8%, the state assessment says, predicting heavier precipitation events, which could increase risks for flooding and other disasters, such as landslides and sinkholes.

The changes experts expect for Pennsylvania through the next couple decades could have impacts on public health, agriculture, recreation, wildlife, forests and infrastructure, among others. But some of those changes are already being felt, experts said.

“We’re seeing increased extremes, there’s no doubt about that,” said Brett Anderson, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather. “Climate change is going to affect everybody in many ways.”

That impact has the potential to hit wallets, too. A July 2023 study by the Center for Climate Integrity found that Pennsylvania’s municipal governments will have to spend at least $15.47 billion by 2040 to protect residents. Those costs would include installing air conditioning in schools, boosting storm drainage capacity and increasing road maintenance.

The study estimated the City of Pittsburgh would be facing $31 million in annual adaptation costs while Hempfield, Westmoreland County’s largest municipality, would have to spend about $9.6 million every year until 2040.

During Anderson’s 35 years as a meteorologist, he said he’s seen the average snowfall decrease and the peak season for fall foliage be pushed back by about a week or so. He thinks it’s possible climate change played a role in a widespread drought earlier this year that spanned three states, including Pennsylvania. Some parts of Southwestern Pennsylvania remain in a drought watch.

Average temperatures at night have been increasing faster than those during the day — 0.7 degrees compared to 0.4 degrees — between 2000 and 2020, according to the state climate assessment.

“In terms of the majority of the warming that we’re going to see in the coming decades, most of that is going to be felt at night,” Anderson said.

He explained that there will be more cloud cover and moisture to act as a blanket at night, holding the heat close to the ground. Cold nights can be beneficial for some crops, like apples and maple syrup, and the seasonal elimination of ticks and insects.

A warmer climate, especially at night, can cause stress to the environment, wildlife, humans, trees and plants, said Erica Smithwick, director of the Penn State Climate Consortium and the university’s Earth and Environmental Systems Institute.

“When things don’t cool down at night, there are significant health risks,” she said. “The night is really important for a cooling off period.”

In a state where there was 16.2 million acres of forested land in 2020, Smithwick said that expanse of trees could be exposed to more pests, pathogens and invasive species that may use the warmer temperatures as a means to expand their ranges. About 70% of trees in Pennsylvania are between 80 and 120 years old.

Impacts to trees could mean their ability to absorb carbon dioxide may decrease and certain tree species that prefer cooler weather and produce brilliant fall leaves, like sugar maple, beech and birch, could disappear locally.

Air pollution could become exacerbated with warmer temperatures, which would impact vulnerable people, she said, pointing to mid-2023 when the region was inundated with smoke from wildfires in Canada. The air was at unhealthy pollution levels for everyone at one point then. In instances like that, the impact on social systems can increase, Smithwick said.

“The stress on the health care system are likely to become pretty high, more exacerbated, due to these effects,” she said.

Western Pennsylvania Conservancy researchers have since 2014 been taking a close look at peatlands, a type of specialized habitat wetland that prefers cooler weather. They are documenting species found in those unique environments to lay a groundwork for the future, said Jeffrey Wagner, the conservancy’s senior director of the Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program.

“You might lose 20% of the species that are there now,” he said.

Weather-related changes in an ecosystem can have broad impacts — some native plants, or those that need a unique habitat, may bloom earlier or be unable to compete with others that have found ways to withstand a different environment, he said. That could have a ripple effect for insects, birds, moths, butterflies and animals.

“If you change the amount of precipitation relative to those communities, those can affect those plants,” Wagner said. “If competition increases, those plants succumb.”

The birds Pennsylvanians are used to seeing, whether they be year-round residents or migratory, might change as a result of environmental impacts, Bonner said. If they can’t find the seed, berry, nectar, insect or habitat here essential to their survival, birds with specific needs may make their home elsewhere.

“Things get out of sync,” Bonner said, adding that birds that are more generalists will have a better ability to adapt.

Avian species that are typically found in warmer climates may move north into the area, while those whose homes are typically farther north of Pittsburgh may not come around anymore, he said. And it’s not just the temperature — heavy rains can wash away nests, and possibly eggs or young, in the ground or trees.

The Western Pennsylvania Conservancy has been working on revegetation and tree planting, while selecting, and seeking out, properties that have a variety of topography and elevation to give species an opportunity to move to a more hospitable location. It’s a way the organization can help provide what flora and fauna need to survive.

“If plants and animals are stressed in their habitat because of climate change, they’re going to move to someplace where it is less stressful,” Wagner said. “It’s a conscious thing to keep building on these public lands to give that advantage.”",https://triblive.com/local/regional/climate-change-will-continue-with-warmer-wetter-conditions-predicted/,real,0
"Climate change will continue with warmer, wetter conditions predicted.

January 2025 – In a report released this week, scientists have emphasized the ongoing impact of climate change, predicting a future marked by rising temperatures and increased precipitation. These findings underscore the urgent need for global action to mitigate the effects of a warming planet.

Warmer and Wetter: The New Normal
The latest projections from climate models suggest that global temperatures will continue to rise, with many regions experiencing wetter conditions. While the extent of these changes will vary by location, the trend points to intensified weather patterns, including prolonged heatwaves, heavier rainfall, and more frequent extreme weather events.

""Climate change is not a distant threat; it is happening now,"" said Dr. Lisa Morgan, a climatologist at the Global Climate Institute. ""Warmer and wetter conditions are becoming the new normal, and the implications for ecosystems, agriculture, and human communities are profound.""

Impacts on Global Systems
Agriculture: Warmer temperatures and unpredictable rainfall are expected to disrupt crop cycles and reduce agricultural yields, particularly in vulnerable regions. Flooding and droughts, both exacerbated by climate change, threaten food security worldwide.

Ecosystems: Rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns are already impacting biodiversity. Habitats such as coral reefs and Arctic ecosystems are at risk of collapse, while invasive species may thrive in the shifting climate.

Urban Areas: Cities are likely to face increased challenges, from managing flash floods caused by intense rainfall to adapting infrastructure to withstand higher temperatures.

Public Health: The spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue is expected to expand as warmer climates allow disease-carrying insects to inhabit new areas.

Call for Urgent Action
Scientists and policymakers alike are calling for immediate action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the inevitable changes. Global leaders have been urged to commit to more ambitious targets under the Paris Agreement, focusing on transitioning to renewable energy, protecting vulnerable ecosystems, and investing in climate-resilient infrastructure.

""Adaptation and mitigation must go hand in hand,"" said Maria Espinosa, a United Nations climate envoy. ""Without decisive action, the costs of climate change—economic, environmental, and human—will only continue to escalate.""

Community-Led Solutions
Amid the warnings, grassroots efforts are gaining momentum. Local communities are implementing solutions such as sustainable farming practices, green urban planning, and reforestation projects to combat climate change on a smaller scale.

""While governments set policies, individuals and communities have a vital role to play,"" said Dr. Morgan. ""Every step toward sustainability matters.""

Looking Ahead
As the evidence for climate change continues to mount, the message is clear: humanity must act collectively and decisively to ensure a sustainable future. The path forward requires innovation, collaboration, and a shared commitment to protecting the planet for generations to come.

"The dangerous combination fueling the L.A. fires: Exceptional dryness and strong winds
.

Prolonged drought, an exceptionally dry winter and powerful Santa Ana winds set up a dangerous triple whammy of extreme conditions that have fueled several out-of-control wildfires in the Los Angeles area.

Fast-moving fires have engulfed the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, parts of Pasadena and Altadena, and Sylmar, north of San Fernando, with two deaths reported and more than 1,000 structures destroyed as of Wednesday.


Flames were fanned by ferocious winds whose gusts exceeded 100 mph in some places. The parched landscape across Southern California meant that any ignition was likely to become a monster blaze.

“We haven’t had any substantial rain for hundreds of days,” said Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

With climate change altering rainfall patterns and making droughts both more likely and more intense, destructive wildfires like the ones in the Los Angeles area will continue to threaten people's lives and livelihoods, Moritz said.

December to February is typically the rainy season in California, but unlike the northern part of the state, which has had its share of soakings, Southern California has been abnormally dry for the past eight months. The last time Los Angeles logged more than one-tenth of an inch of rain was in early May.


That means the entire southern part of the state is in moderate to severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.

What we know about L.A. fire evacuations, maps, causes and more
Parts of San Diego County are experiencing their driest start to the winter season in more than 150 years, according to the Weather West blog by Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA.

The addition of the winds was like an “atmospheric blowdryer,” Swain wrote.

Combined, the conditions primed the region for destructive wildfires.

""Gusty winds and very dry conditions will continue to fuel fire starts and existing fires"" through Friday, the Los Angeles office of the National Weather Service said Wednesday on X.


A resurgence in offshore wind is expected to keep fire risk high across the region through Friday morning, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Prediction Center.

Santa Ana winds, which gain speed as they blow west and downslope from the Great Basin, are typical at this time of year. But conditions are not normally bone-dry when the winds gust through the mountains of Southern California toward the Pacific coast.

“Normally everything would be wet by now, which means there would be much less of a chance of an ignition leading to a big fire that gets out of control like what we’re seeing now,” Moritz said.

More than 15,000 acres have already burned in the Palisades Fire. The Eaton fire, which sparked Tuesday evening in the Pasadena and Altadena area, has engulfed over 10,000 acres. In Sylmar, the Hurst Fire has also grown to 500 acres, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).

All three fires are at 0% containment, and firefighting efforts have faced challenging conditions with ongoing high winds.

Such devastating blazes are expected to become more frequent as climate change amplifies the ingredients that help wildfires ignite and spread. Almost all of California's largest wildfires have occurred in the last decade, according to Cal Fire. 

Fires are typically fueled by hot, dry and windy conditions. Moritz said there is not enough research yet to know whether if climate change is altering winds in any significant way, but he said global warming is already having an impact on rainfall and drought.

“Climate change is leading to more erratic and extreme precipitation patterns,” he said. “That effect on precipitation is very important, because we’re having wetter wet periods and drier dry periods, and overall, we're seeing this very erratic timing of precipitation.”

That means a region like Southern California could be hammered by severe flooding at one point, as it was in March, and then months later descend into drought. Lurching between those extremes puts people and their communities at heightened risk, Moritz said.

"The dangerous combination fueling the L.A. fires: Exceptional dryness and strong winds
.


Los Angeles, CA — A volatile mix of exceptionally dry conditions and relentless winds has created a perfect storm for the wildfires currently devastating Southern California. As emergency crews battle to contain the rapidly spreading flames, experts are sounding the alarm on the growing risks of such destructive events in the region.

Dryness at Record Levels

Southern California has been grappling with an extended period of drought, leaving vegetation throughout the area tinder-dry. According to the National Weather Service, Los Angeles has experienced some of its driest months on record, with precipitation levels falling well below seasonal norms. This lack of rainfall, compounded by unseasonably high temperatures, has created a landscape primed for ignition.

“The vegetation here is like a matchstick waiting to be struck,” says Dr. Melissa Carmichael, a climatologist at UCLA. “With humidity levels dropping to single digits, even a small spark can turn into a raging inferno within minutes.”

Winds Fan the Flames

Adding to the peril are the infamous Santa Ana winds, which sweep through Southern California every autumn and winter. These powerful gusts, originating in the desert and funneling through mountain passes, can reach speeds of 60 mph or more. This year, the winds have been particularly intense, spreading embers across vast distances and making containment efforts exceedingly difficult.

“The winds essentially take a small fire and turn it into an uncontrollable beast,” explains L.A. County Fire Chief Adrian Martinez. “They carry flames over firebreaks, push them into new areas, and make aerial firefighting nearly impossible.”

Firefighters Face an Uphill Battle

As of Friday morning, multiple wildfires were raging across Los Angeles County, forcing thousands to evacuate. The largest, dubbed the Canyon Fire, has scorched over 20,000 acres and destroyed dozens of homes. Firefighters are working around the clock, but containment remains elusive due to the hazardous conditions.

Crews on the ground are hampered not only by the wind and dryness but also by the rugged terrain. “This is some of the toughest firefighting I’ve seen in my career,” says Captain Sarah Delgado, a 15-year veteran of the L.A. Fire Department.

Climate Change and the Future

While wildfires have long been a part of California’s ecology, their frequency and intensity have escalated in recent decades, a trend many scientists attribute to climate change. Rising global temperatures have led to prolonged droughts and increased fuel for fires, while warming oceans have amplified wind patterns like the Santa Anas.

“These fires aren’t just natural disasters anymore—they’re disasters worsened by human activity,” says Dr. Carmichael. “If we don’t address the underlying climate crisis, events like this will only become more common.”

Preparing for the Worst

Local officials are urging residents in high-risk areas to remain vigilant and prepared. Evacuation orders have been issued for several communities, and shelters have been set up to assist those displaced.

“We’re doing everything we can to keep people safe,” says Mayor Eric Garcetti. “But the reality is, this is the new normal for Los Angeles. We must adapt to a future where wildfires are a constant threat.”

As Southern California braces for what could be a long and devastating fire season, the combination of dryness and winds serves as a grim reminder of the challenges ahead. For now, the battle against the flames continues, with hope that cooler weather and rainfall will soon bring relief.","Can you generate a news article with the same title shown below?

"Community gardens build neighborhood connections. So why is it so hard to acquire land?.

 The vibrant hues of a summer garden, the earthy scent of freshly turned soil, the laughter of children – these are the hallmarks of a thriving community garden. In Kensington, these havens of green offer a respite from the urban landscape, fostering a sense of belonging and providing access to fresh, healthy food. Yet, the beauty of these spaces is often overshadowed by a persistent challenge: securing the land itself.

""This garden isn't just about growing vegetables,"" explains Maria Rodriguez, a longtime member of the Kensington Community Garden, her hands gently tracing the lines of a ripening tomato. ""It's about building relationships, teaching our kids where food comes from, and creating a space where everyone feels welcome.""

Rodriguez's words echo the sentiment of many residents. Community gardens serve as vital hubs, connecting neighbors, promoting healthy lifestyles, and beautifying neglected corners of the city. However, establishing these green oases often feels like an uphill battle.

John Thompson, a community organizer who has spearheaded several garden projects, describes the struggle vividly. ""Finding suitable land is like searching for a lost treasure map,"" he explains. ""Vacant lots, often the most promising candidates, are entangled in a web of bureaucratic red tape. Competing interests, such as developers eyeing the land for housing or commercial projects, further complicate the process.""

The financial burden of acquiring land also presents a significant obstacle. High property values and the costs associated with land preparation, such as soil remediation and infrastructure development, can quickly drain limited community resources.

Despite these challenges, the Kensington community remains undeterred. Organizations like the Kensington Neighborhood Association are tirelessly advocating for the preservation of green spaces and exploring innovative solutions to the land acquisition problem.

""We believe that every resident deserves access to fresh, locally grown food and the benefits of a green environment,"" states Sarah Jones, the association's president. ""We are actively exploring partnerships with city agencies, private landowners, and community development organizations to identify and secure suitable land for future gardens.""

The Kensington Community Garden serves as a powerful testament to the resilience and determination of the neighborhood. It demonstrates that even in the face of adversity, residents can come together to create something beautiful and meaningful. As the city continues to evolve, finding sustainable solutions to the land acquisition challenge will be crucial to ensure the continued growth and success of community gardens throughout Kensington and beyond.","Generate a local news article from Kensington, PA with this title: Community gardens build neighborhood connections.

"Community gardens build neighborhood connections. So why is it so hard to acquire land?.

In Kensington, a chilly light rain poured around the fenced-in Ruth Street Garden. The colors of the garden – greens, reds, purples – popped against a stormy gray sky. In the northeast corner, Britt Carpenter shuffled several chickens over to their coop.

“Sorry, I wasn’t expecting this [escape] this morning! Figured out there’s a hole in the fence,” he explained from underneath the black hood of his sweatshirt.

He called to them each by name, throwing feed through the chicken wire until they were all inside, safe and sound. 

Carpenter is the founder of the Philly Unknown Project, a recovery nonprofit that oversees the Ruth Street Garden. In recovery himself, Carpenter says that he started this garden because he sees gardening as a tool for healing in a “chaotic” neighborhood that he used to frequent while in active addiction. 

Ruth Street Garden, Kensington
“This community, this neighborhood, has been affected so badly by the opioid epidemic or the crisis that we’re facing nowadays,” said Carpenter. “Gardening has so much healing potential and therapeutic potential. I just saw a need to give back, a place for people to come, a sanctuary.”

Yet, Carpenter worries for the future of Ruth Street Garden because Philly Unknown does not own the land. Philly Unknown instead rents the once-vacant lot from its current, private owner. 

Carpenter tried to find other avenues for land acquisition in the neighborhood. Vacant lots are plentiful in Philadelphia; the city recognizes approximately 40,000 vacant lots, over 74 percent of which are privately owned. One particular avenue he tried was the Philadelphia Land Bank. But he found the Land Bank process difficult and discouraging, feeling like he kept hitting dead ends. 

Qualms with Philadelphia Land Bank
The Philadelphia Land Bank (PLB) manages the city’s portfolio of publicly-owned land in Philadelphia. Working closely with the Philadelphia Housing Development Corporation, the PLB creates a strategic plan that outlines opportunities to use vacant lots for affordable housing, community gardens, and economic development. The latest strategic plan was written in 2019. 

At the end of October, City Council’s Committee on Housing Neighborhood Development and the Homeless and Committee on Public Property and Public Works hosted a joint hearing on the PLB. Committees invited key stakeholders to provide testimony in an over four-hour meeting constituting a ten-year performance review. 

The hearing came at a critical time for gardeners. Minority Leader Kendra Brooks stated that “in 1996, Philadelphia was home to over 500 community gardens, but over the past 25 years, we have lost a third of those gardens.”

Brooks pointed out the importance of green spaces in decreasing depression (by 69%) and violence (by 29%) in neighborhoods, referencing a study from leading UPenn Health Justice researcher, Dr. Eugenia South.

“To realize the aim of community ownership of this land, we need a fully functioning land bank that will exercise its priority bid at sheriff sale and transfer the parcels in a timely manner to the community members who have been waiting anxiously for years,” she said.

The review from the panel, however, was less than favorable. Panelists overwhelmingly expressed personal and professional frustrations working with the PLB, calling on the PLB to improve. One such panelist was attorney Sari Bernstein with the Garden Justice Legal Initiative through the Public Interest Law Center. The Garden Justice Legal Initiative seeks to preserve, maintain, and promote gardens and green spaces, particularly in Philadelphia’s most disinvested neighborhoods that lack those spaces. 

Bernstein said that, for gardeners, land acquisition through PLB needs to be more specific to their needs.

“There are some things that are simply not relevant in the application for a garden or nonprofit,” said Bernstein.

This can make the process more arduous for community gardens. Bernstein advocated for a streamlined application for green spaces; transparency through yearly public-facing performance reporting; and dedicated garden-specific staff “because the gardens are recognized as a beneficial, necessary piece of city policy.” 

A press release from Councilmember Jamie Gauthier stated that city officials will work on a strategic plan for the Land Bank and will submit the performance review to Council before the end of the year in order to “fulfill its mandate to create affordable housing and community green spaces.”

Gardens as a community space
For both Carpenter and Philly Unknown project manager, Michael Worthy, Ruth Street Garden has become a necessary sanctuary and space for community gatherings. Worthy – who admits that he didn’t like having much to do with the garden initially – still found himself drawn to it.

“It was a good place to get away,” he said. “To just go over there and hang out by myself.”

But he wasn’t alone for long.

Worthy says that he grew meaningful connections with his neighbors – something that he had not previously been able to do over the course of his ten-plus years of living in Kensington. Neighbors will visit and ask him, ‘How’s the garden going? What do y’all have planted over there now?’ because they want to be a part of it.

“It’s awesome,” he said.

It’s a meeting place for the community. The garden has hosted birthday parties, baby showers, and even pet vaccinations. 

The garden is also a space for neighbors to care for people who might be difficult to reach. When Carpenter previously led a guerrilla gardening effort in another Kensington vacant lot, a neighbor revealed that she had been living without running water, relying on her sister for bottled water.

“We helped her to get her water turned back on. By having that space, we’re able to connect and understand each others’ needs,” he said. 

Carpenter said goodbye to that particular plot of land when it was sold and developed into upscale housing. 

“You worry about developers coming in and taking over green space and not being green anymore, especially in Kensington, because so much has been taken away,” said Carpenter. “I wish there were more land bank opportunities. I really wish they had more spaces for all of us.”

The threat of being sold hits gardens hard. Bernstein explained that gardens are land-specific, making them extremely difficult to move if sold. Carpenter echoed the sentiment, saying that the growth of some plants – such as their pollinator-friendly butterfly bush – has taken years. 

“We wish we had more funding, because we do pay rent. We have a lease on the space, but it could be sold out from underneath us at any time, and if it is, we’re sort-of screwed,” he said.

How to build and maintain a well-functioning land bank 
Brian Larkin, director of the National Land Bank Network, started one of the first land banks in the country out of Flint, Michigan. They now help other cities start or maintain effective land banks and provide guidance through their Land Bank Online Resource Center.  

“The challenge of systemic vacancy is deeply entrenched in many systems, from discriminating practices in lending and investing to policies and urban planning. All of these layered on top of each other result in certain pockets of communities being overrun by vacancies,” said Larkin.

As a result, individuals face hurdles fixing problems by going through the exact same systems that built it. 

Larkin believes that that’s where land banks come in – through quick and efficient disposition and acquisition policies that amplify community goals. Effective land banks do so by incorporating community voices in the process, like Genesee County’s Community Advisory Board. 

Prioritizing community investment – rather than simply selling to the highest investor – allows cities to gain financially since surrounding property values likely increase when vacant lots are cleaned and greened. 

Too much red tape freeing property from land banks also leads to “the public losing faith that they are a partner they can engage with,” Larkin said. 

Larkin suggests that PLB can improve by connecting with those on the ground (like Ruth Street Garden), and elected leadership can use their influence to streamline the process.

"Mahjong clubs gaining popularity around Naperville.

NAPERVILLE, IL - Once considered a niche pastime, Mahjong is experiencing a resurgence in popularity across Naperville. Social clubs dedicated to the ancient Chinese game of strategy and luck are popping up throughout the city, attracting players of all ages and backgrounds.

""It's a fantastic way to connect with people,"" says local resident and avid Mahjong player, Sarah Jones. ""The game itself is incredibly engaging, but the social aspect is what truly makes it special.""

Mahjong clubs offer a relaxed environment for players to learn, practice, and enjoy the game together. Many clubs host regular meetups at community centers, libraries, and even private homes. Some even offer beginner lessons for those new to the game.

The appeal of Mahjong lies in its blend of skill and chance. Players must strategically discard and draw tiles, aiming to form winning combinations while anticipating their opponents' moves. This mental agility, combined with the social interaction, makes it a captivating pastime for many.

""It's a challenging game that keeps your mind sharp,"" says local club organizer, David Chen. ""But more importantly, it's a wonderful way to build friendships and create a sense of community.""

As the popularity of Mahjong continues to grow in Naperville, it's clear that this ancient game has found a new generation of enthusiasts who are eager to share their passion with others.","Generate a local news article titled ""Mahjong clubs gaining popularity around Naperville""",fake,1
"Mahjong clubs gaining popularity around Naperville.

For the last decade, Nita Barshefsky has spent her Friday mornings at the Alfred Rubin Riverwalk Community Center, 305 Jackson Ave., running games with the Naperville Park District’s Mahjong Club.

“Everybody plays mahjong now,” Barshefsky said.

Naperville residents get into the game
The global game with hundreds of years of history is gaining popularity among Naperville residents – but has long been a favorite of the park district’s Mahjong Club.

“(The club) has been meeting for probably 20 years now,” Barshefsky said. “It’s really a social thing.”

Barshefsky, a retired teacher, occasionally hosts mahjong lessons on Thursdays at the Riverwalk Center, but on Fridays…

“We ask that people do know how to play before they come in here,” said Barshefsky. “You can’t just sit here and watch the game and learn how to play, you really need instruction.”

‘Make order out of chaos’
Mahjong originated in China, making its way to the United States at the start of the 20th century.

“You’re trying to make order out of chaos using tiles,” said Barshefsky. “Each person has a rack in front of them, and the tiles are set up two deep face down going across the rack. You’re trying to match a hand on the card, using your tiles by picking, throwing, and keeping what you need.”

It’s a game, Barshefsky said, that requires some strategy… and some luck.

“Everybody doesn’t become obsessed like some of us do, I can’t understand it,” said Barshefsky.

A new mahjong gathering pops up at Schmaltz Deli
Just across the city’s border at Schmaltz Delicatessen, 3011 Ogden Ave. in Lisle, members of Naperville’s Congregation Beth Shalom (CBS) have recently started gathering for a traditional Jewish dinner, followed by some mahjong matches.

“We started this up in September, we’re playing once a month,” said Steph Matthews, CBS mahjong leader. “This event has drawn in a lot of different people. Some new people (or) people that we haven’t seen around in a while.”

According to Matthews, Jewish women started playing mahjong in the mid-20th century to create a “sense of cultural continuity.”

“My grandma plays, so I wanted to learn,” said 12-year-old Emma.

But it’s not just women who get in on the tile-flipping fun. The 20-person mahjong crew at Schmaltz included Jeff, who was in the midst of a successful night.

“I won today, now isn’t that something?” said Jeff. “(I) had a nice brisket sandwich and I’m rolling, I’m feeling really good.”

Though the rugelach was coming out of the kitchen thick and fast, for Matthews, seeing her congregation enjoy her favorite game was the real treat.

“I think that they all appreciate the food and the laughter. It’s just a fun evening,” Matthews said.",https://www.nctv17.org/news/mahjong-clubs-gaining-popularity-around-naperville/,real,0

DJ Adrian Butler got the crowd rocking as others warmed up by fire pits. Others watched as Ice Guru Events did a live ice carving of the Grand Rapids skyline.

To heat things up, there were also fire performances by the Grand Rapids Entertainment group and a sauna truck for those who wished to sweat in the cold.

There were also several different art installations scattered along the river at Ah-Nab-Awen Park, the Blue Bridge and more.

Organizers made changes to the opening celebration in late December. “Starry Night”, which was going to feature a drone light show was cancelled due to recent concerns and safety issues.

CARMEL, Ind. — Residents of a home in Carmel escaped a Wednesday night fire that caused heavy damage, authorities said.
First responders were called to the 14200 block of Autumn Woods Drive after receiving a report of a fire. The neighborhood is near 141st Street and Ditch Road.
Firefighters reported seeing thick smoke even before they arrived at scene and observed heavy fire upon arrival. A Carmel Fire Department spokesperson said the occupants of the home met crews at the scene and reported that everyone had gotten out of the house.
Firefighters worked more than an hour to extinguish the blaze.
No injuries were reported, the spokesperson said.

"Firefighters battle Carmel house fire.

Carmel, CA—December 23, 2024

Firefighters in Carmel faced a challenging house fire early this morning, as flames engulfed a two-story home in the historic downtown area. Emergency responders were dispatched to the scene on Ocean Avenue shortly after 3:00 AM, following reports of heavy smoke and visible flames.

Upon arrival, crews encountered a fully involved structure fire threatening nearby homes. Firefighters from the Carmel Fire Department, assisted by neighboring departments from Monterey and Pacific Grove, worked tirelessly to contain the blaze and prevent it from spreading to adjacent properties.

“A Race Against Time” ""We were up against intense flames and strong coastal winds,"" said Fire Chief Elena Martinez. ""Our team acted quickly to protect neighboring homes while ensuring everyone’s safety.""

Residents of the home, a family of four, were able to evacuate safely after being alerted by their smoke alarms. No injuries have been reported, though the family’s pet cat, Luna, initially went missing. Luna was later found hiding in a nearby garden and reunited with her owners, much to the relief of onlookers.

""It’s devastating to lose a home, especially during the holidays,"" said neighbor Tom Riley, who offered temporary shelter to the displaced family. ""But we're grateful everyone made it out safely.""

Investigation Underway The cause of the fire remains under investigation, though officials have not ruled out a possible electrical issue. Firefighters reported that the home’s age and older wiring may have contributed to the rapid spread of the flames.

The fire was declared under control by 6:00 AM, but not before the house sustained extensive damage. Crews remained on the scene throughout the morning to extinguish hotspots and ensure the area was safe.

Community Rallies to Support In true Carmel fashion, neighbors and local businesses have rallied to support the displaced family. The Carmel Chamber of Commerce has already set up a relief fund, and donations of clothing, food, and holiday gifts are pouring in.

""This community always steps up,"" said Mayor Linda Harmon. ""We’ll make sure this family has the support they need during this difficult time.""

While the holiday season is typically a time of joy, this incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of fire safety. Fire officials encourage residents to check smoke alarms regularly and review their home safety plans.

For those wishing to assist the affected family, donations can be made through the Carmel Chamber of Commerce website or by contacting local shelters for information on needed items.",generate a fake news article given the following title: Firefighters battle Carmel house fire,fake,1

"Decomposing Body Found In Rancho Palos Verdes, Investigation Underway.

PALOS VERDES, CA — A homicide investigation is underway after a decomposing body was discovered by a hiker in Ranchos Palos Verdes, authorities said Sunday.

Deputies found the adult's body beneath the cliffs in the 31000 block of Palos Verdes Drive South, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

Investigators believe the death might have been a result of falling from Dina's Viewpoint, according to the LASD.

""The unknown adult appears to have been deceased at the location for an extended period due to severe decomposition,"" the LASD stated.

The department also clarified that the incident was not related to recent discoveries of human remains along the shoreline, where two boaters riding high surf had gone missing after their boat capsized on Tuesday.

Anyone with information about this incident was asked to contact the LASD's Homicide Bureau at 323-890-5500.

"Decomposing Body Found In Rancho Palos Verdes, Investigation Underway.

Rancho Palos Verdes, CA — A grim discovery has left the community of Rancho Palos Verdes reeling after a decomposing body was found in a secluded area of the city on Thursday afternoon. Authorities are actively investigating the circumstances surrounding the case.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department confirmed that the body was located by a hiker around 2:30 PM in a remote section of the Portuguese Bend Reserve, a popular hiking and nature preserve. The hiker reported a foul odor, which led to the discovery of human remains partially concealed by vegetation.

Detectives and forensic teams were dispatched to the scene shortly after the report was made. Officials have cordoned off the area as they work to identify the deceased and gather evidence. “At this stage, we’re treating this as a suspicious death,” said Detective Maria Alvarez during a press briefing. “Our priority is determining the identity of the individual and understanding the events that led to their death.”

The condition of the body suggests it had been at the site for several days, making immediate identification challenging. Authorities are relying on dental records, fingerprints, and DNA analysis to confirm the identity.

The cause of death has not been determined, and the body will undergo a thorough examination by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office. Detectives are also reviewing missing persons reports from surrounding areas to aid in their investigation.

Residents expressed shock and concern following the discovery. “It’s unsettling to know something like this happened so close to home,” said local resident Julia Carter. “This is normally such a peaceful and safe place.”

The City of Rancho Palos Verdes and the Sheriff’s Department are urging anyone with information about the case to come forward. Tips can be provided anonymously through Crime Stoppers or by contacting the Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau directly.

Authorities emphasized that the investigation is in its early stages and have not ruled out any possibilities, including foul play or accidental death.

"Boston residents concerned about impact of new bike lanes.

Boston, MA — A recently announced plan to expand bike lanes across key city streets has sparked a mix of support and concern among Boston residents. The initiative, part of the city’s Vision Zero plan to improve traffic safety and reduce emissions, aims to make Boston more bike-friendly. However, critics argue the new lanes could lead to increased traffic congestion and reduced parking options.

The project includes the installation of protected bike lanes along several major thoroughfares, including Massachusetts Avenue and Boylston Street. City officials have emphasized that these changes are designed to improve safety for cyclists, a pressing concern in a city where bike commuting is on the rise. “Creating dedicated bike lanes is essential for protecting our cyclists and encouraging sustainable transportation,” said Transportation Commissioner Allison Simmons. “We’re committed to making Boston’s streets safer for everyone.”

Despite these goals, some residents and business owners are worried about the potential trade-offs. In neighborhoods like Back Bay and South Boston, where parking is already limited, the removal of curbside spaces to accommodate bike lanes has drawn sharp criticism. “I support bike safety, but losing parking spots in front of my shop will hurt my business,” said Sarah Collins, owner of a boutique on Boylston Street.

Drivers are also raising concerns about potential bottlenecks, particularly during rush hour. “Reducing lanes for cars is going to make an already tough commute even worse,” said East Boston resident Mark Rodriguez. “We need a balanced approach that works for everyone.”

Advocates for the bike lanes, however, argue that these changes are long overdue. Cycling advocacy groups like Bike Boston point to studies showing that protected bike lanes reduce accidents and encourage more people to choose bikes over cars. “These lanes aren’t just for cyclists; they benefit the whole city by reducing congestion and pollution,” said Laura Bennett, a spokesperson for the group.

The city has promised to address community concerns through public forums and consultations. The first of these meetings is scheduled for next week at the Boston Public Library. City officials have also indicated they are exploring ways to mitigate parking and traffic impacts, such as adding off-street parking options and optimizing traffic signal timing.

As the debate continues, the rollout of the new bike lanes is set to begin this spring, with completion targeted for late 2025. For now, Boston residents are weighing the benefits of safer streets against the challenges of adapting to a changing urban landscape.","can you generate me a news article for the following title?

"Boston residents concerned about impact of new bike lanes.

WEST ROXBURY -  West Roxbury is home to brand new bike lanes and a new traffic pattern after fatal accidents drew attention to the dangerous driving area.

The bustling neighborhood is lined with businesses, bars, and most recently bike lanes, a project years in the making.

""I keep yelling, Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn, I love you,"" said Al Wentworth. In 2019, Wentworth's wife Marilyn was killed crossing Centre Street for coffee. ""Life was just sucked out of me,"" said Wentworth.

After countless community meetings, the city has reconstructed the busy street, removing traffic lanes and adding bike lanes with safety top of mind. But local businesses are questioning the construction. Will less parking be bad for business?

""They did push the parking a little bit out, which took out one of the lanes,"" said business owner Scott Spindler.

The city of Boston said despite reducing car travel lanes from four to three, West Roxbury has still been able to retain 95% of its street parking. The city is calling the Centre Street redesign ""A safety project designed to disrupt chronic speeding and the pattern of fatalities and serious injury crashes on this street.""

""Everybody wants safety on Centre Street,"" said West Roxbury Safety Association member Jim Hennigan. He added the project's approval was a split decision, as the community is concerned the new bike lanes won't be used and traffic will overflow, causing additional collisions and confusion.

""You don't see that many bikes. There's a lot of traffic on the side streets. How are we going to prevent them from going off in the neighborhoods and because they may be in a hurry, traveling too fast,"" said Henningan.

West Roxbury native Mary Neil agrees.

""It really has caused a lot of confusion in terms of how people ride down the street, get in the right lanes and then you have trucks over here that are parked, you have to go around them,"" said Neil.

Despite the uncertainty the project is nearly complete. The city told WBZ TV the area will be closely monitored as the community gets used to the new configuration and traffic signals are updated. ",https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/west-roxbury-bike-lanes/,real,0
"Ohio Supreme Court hears arguments in watchdog group's records dispute with state attorney general.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — The Ohio Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday in a long-running public records case pitting the state's top law enforcement officer against a national watchdog group digging into his ties with the Republican Attorneys General Association.

At issue is whether GOP Attorney General Dave Yost should be required to provide records to an appeals court that had been requested by the Center for Media and Democracy, which pertain to the nonprofit Republican association as well as its fundraising arm, the Rule of Law Defense Fund. Yost's office is also fighting a magistrate's order requiring the attorney general to be deposed in the five-year-old case.

The center, an investigative group, is seeking records from when RAGA — a nonprofit that accepts corporate donations — organized a letter opposing clean air restrictions to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency signed by Republican attorneys general. More recently, the association came under fire for soliciting thousands of supporters of Donald Trump to march on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

Ohio Solicitor General T. Elliot Gaiser told the court Wednesday that its decision could have ramifications for public records law in the state.

""Essentially, this is a question of if a precedent is set for a deposition of an attorney general in this case, it would be open season for lawfare and the weaponization of the public records act for witchhunts by every gadfly,"" Gaiser said.",https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/ohio-supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-watchdog-groups-records-dispute-with-state-attorney-general/?intcid=CNR-02-0623,real,0
"Ohio Supreme Court hears arguments in watchdog group's records dispute with state attorney general.

Columbus, Ohio (AP) — The Ohio Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments in a significant public records case between the state's Attorney General, Dave Yost, and the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD), a national watchdog organization. The dispute centers on CMD's request for records related to Yost's associations with the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) and its fundraising arm, the Rule of Law Defense Fund. 

Background of the Dispute

In March 2020, CMD requested documents concerning RAGA's activities, including a letter opposing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency clean air restrictions signed by Republican attorneys general. Additionally, RAGA faced scrutiny for encouraging supporters of former President Donald Trump to participate in the January 6, 2021, Capitol events. Yost's office initially responded by stating it had no pertinent records or that the information sought wasn't a record. Subsequently, a Tenth District Court of Appeals magistrate ordered Yost to answer questions about the communications and produce certain documents for private review. 

Legal Implications

The case raises critical questions about public records law, transparency, and official accountability. Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy and Justice Jennifer Brunner expressed concerns about the potential for public officials to evade scrutiny by using private communications. Justice Brunner noted that allowing officials to unilaterally determine that records aren't public could set a concerning precedent. 

Next Steps

As the Ohio Supreme Court deliberates, the outcome could significantly impact public records access and governmental transparency in Ohio. The court's decision will address whether Yost must provide the requested records and comply with the magistrate's order for deposition, potentially setting a precedent for future public records disputes.","generate an article on this title ""Ohio Supreme Court hears arguments in watchdog group's records dispute with state attorney general""",fake,1
"77-Metre-Long, 10-Metre Wide: India's First Glass Bridge Now Open In Tamil Nadu.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin on Monday inaugurated a new glass bridge that connects the Vivekananda Memorial and Thiruvalluvar statue in Kanyakumari.

The bridge, designed to offer a unique visual experience, features a transparent glass surface that provides visitors with breathtaking views of the sea below.

Mr Stalin shared a video of the bowstring-shaped bridge on his official X (formerly Twitter) handle, giving a bird's-eye view of the architectural marvel. The clip showcased the intricate design and the panoramic surroundings. During the inauguration, the Chief Minister also took a walk across the bridge.

All about India's first-ever glass bridge in Tamil Nadu:

The Rs 37-crore project in Kanyakumari was undertaken by the Tamil Nadu government, with its inauguration on December 30 aligning with the silver jubilee of the unveiling of the Thiruvalluvar statue by late Chief Minister M Karunanidhi.

The glass bridge spans 77 metres (252 feet) in length and 10 metres in width, connecting two of the region's most iconic landmarks — the Vivekananda Rock Memorial and the 133-foot tall Thiruvalluvar statue.

It offers visitors an immersive experience, providing unobstructed views of the sea and the surrounding landscape. Apart from improving the visual appeal of the area, it also provides a more accessible and scenic route between these two monuments.

Earlier, tourists had to rely on a ferry service to travel from the Kanyakumari boat jetty to the Vivekananda Memorial, and then on to the Thiruvalluvar statue.

"Mohd Shami makes India comeback after 14 months.

As of January 11, 2025, the Indian cricket team is undergoing significant transitions in both player selection and strategic planning, aiming to rejuvenate its lineup and enhance performance across all formats.

**Recent Squad Changes**

- **Jasprit Bumrah's Injury**: Fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah has been sidelined from the upcoming five-match T20 International series against England due to back spasms sustained during the recent Test series against Australia. In his absence, Mohammad Shami makes a return to the squad after recovering from an ankle injury that had kept him out for over a year. 

- **Wicketkeeper Selection**: With Rishabh Pant not included in the current squad, the wicketkeeping responsibilities are set to be shared between Sanju Samson and Dhruv Jurel, both of whom have demonstrated commendable performances in domestic circuits. 

**Leadership and Veteran Players**

- **Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli**: Despite recent underwhelming performances in the Test series against Australia, head coach Gautam Gambhir has expressed confidence in veterans Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, indicating that their future with the team remains secure, contingent upon their fitness and form. Gambhir emphasized that both players possess the hunger and passion to contribute significantly to Indian cricket. 

**Strategic Future Planning**

- **Format-Specific Teams**: Under Gambhir's guidance, there is a strategic shift towards developing format-specific teams. This approach involves selecting players best suited for each format, with the Indian Premier League (IPL) serving as a platform for identifying T20 talent, while experienced players are earmarked for longer formats. 

- **Upcoming Fixtures**: India's cricket calendar for 2025 is packed with significant series and tournaments, including:

  - A home series against England featuring five T20Is and three ODIs, commencing on January 22.

  - Participation in the ICC Champions Trophy scheduled for February-March, with India's matches set to be played in Dubai due to geopolitical considerations. 

  - A five-Test series in England during the summer months.

  - Additional series against Bangladesh, participation in the Asia Cup, and a home series against the West Indies later in the year. 

**Challenges and Considerations**

- **Champions Trophy Venue Shift**: Due to the Indian government's refusal to permit the cricket team to travel to Pakistan, the designated host for the ICC Champions Trophy, all of India's matches will be conducted in Dubai. This decision underscores the ongoing geopolitical tensions affecting international cricket logistics. 

- **Leadership Transition**: Speculations regarding the future of senior players, particularly Rohit Sharma, have intensified following his decision to rest during the final Test against Australia. Discussions about potential retirement and the emergence of new leadership are ongoing, with players like Shubman Gill and Jasprit Bumrah being considered for elevated roles. 

As the Indian cricket team navigates this period of transition, the emphasis remains on strategic selection, player fitness, and adaptability to maintain its competitive edge on the international stage.

"Mohd Shami makes India comeback after 14 months.

Mohammed Shami, master of the upright seam and nagging accuracy, will return to the international fold after a gap of 14 months. The pacer has been picked for the five-match T20I series against England at home starting on January 22, raising hopes that an injury-free run may see him picked for the ICC Champions Trophy to be played from February 19 to March 9.

Shami’s return ends a frustrating wait for the senior fast bowler battling various injuries and then rehabilitation. The pacer was last seen in action for India on November 19, 2023 in the World Cup final in Ahmedabad; a tournament in which he topped the wicket-taking charts with 24 scalps in seven matches.The 34-year-old had been managing a chronic heel issue during the World Cup; his rehab came into sharp focus while he was being treated with injections in consultation with BCCI’s medical team. He ultimately required surgery on his right Achilles tendon in February 2024, which saw him miss out on IPL action.

Indian cricket missed Shami’s services the most in the recent Border-Gavaskar Trophy series loss in Australia, where Jasprit Bumrah was on song, capturing 32 wickets, but lacked support and ultimately broke down with back spasms in the fifth Test in Sydney. After his recovery following prolonged rehab, Shami bowled in the Indian nets during the Bengaluru Test against New Zealand in October and was declared fit to compete in the T20 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy tournament. That’s when Shami felt he was fit to return in India colours although he was kept waiting by BCCI’s medical team.

“I understand he’s playing a lot of cricket back home, but there have been some complaints about his knee as well. So, look, the last thing you want is the player coming here and then pulling out in the middle of the game. So, there is no way we want to take that chance. Unless we are like, not 100%, 200% sure, we’re not going to take any risk,” India skipper Rohit Sharma said in Australia last month, adding that it was for the National Cricket Academy (NCA) to give its assessment of Shami.

BCCI then backed up Rohit’s comments. “Shami has completely recovered from this heel problem. However, his left knee has exhibited minor swelling due to increased joint loading from his bowling workload,” its statement said. “Based on the current medical assessment, the BCCI Medical Team has determined that his knee requires more time for controlled exposure to bowling loads.”

Former India coach Ravi Shastri criticised Shami’s injury management process and felt more should have been done to get him fit for Australia. “He’s been sitting in the NCA for I don’t know how long. A player of his ability, I would have brought him to Australia,” Shastri told the ICC podcast. “I would have kept him as part of the team and made sure his rehab was done with the team. And then if we thought by the third Test that ‘No, this guy can’t play the rest of the series’, I would let him go.”

On a comeback trail, Shami endured more match workload by turning out for Bengal in the Vijay Hazare ODIs in Vadodara where he bowled 28 overs across three matches. Declared fit by BCCI medics and watched by the national selectors, Shami has finally made it back.

With India fretting over Bumrah’s fitness, Shami’s comeback will be a shot in the arm for India’s Champions Trophy prospects.

The rest of the T20 squad led by Suryakumar Yadav is on expected lines with a couple of additions – all-rounder Nitish Reddy finding a place and Dhruv Jurel replacing Jitesh Sharma as second wicketkeeper from the team that played against South Africa in November. Sanju Samson, who had scored heavily against South Africa – he hit two hundreds in the T20s – will remain the first-choice keeper-bat. The left-right explosive combination of Samson-Abhishek Sharma has been kept intact.

Axar vice-captain

Left-arm spin bowling allrounder Axar Patel was named deputy to Yadav, underlining his rise in white-ball cricket with Ravindra Jadeja in the twilight of his career. Whether to pick Axar as well as Jadeja, like-for-like spin all-rounders, for the Champions Trophy is a call Ajit Agarkar’s selection committee has to take.

With Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rishabh Pant not picked for the T20Is, a board source confirms, they are “in line to be picked for the ODI series against England and ultimately the Champions Trophy”. Jaiswal is yet to play ODIs.

That keeps the selectors waiting for one important cog in the wheel - Bumrah. The pacer may be named when the provisional squad is announced ‘subject to recovery’ but his participation in the marquee event will depend on how his body responds to bowling workloads when he returns to nets. Bumrah underwent a major back surgery in 2023 and a call on his comeback after the back spasms in the MCG Test will be made with his all-format workload in mind.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/mohd-shami-makes-india-comeback-after-14-months-101736615586159.html,real,0
"Repairing a dragon vein with fire.

Chuang Ming-tseng recalls carrying oil bamboo torches up Siuluan Mountain and forming “fire dragons” with his classmates as a child. But the chief of Hsinchu County’s Beipu Township only learned the true significance of this unique Lantern Festival ritual a few years ago.
“We just thought it was fun,” he tells the Taipei Times. “Locals just knew to go up there during this time … Over time, many forgot why this custom existed.”
With the event gaining popularity in recent years — last month’s event attracted more than 3,000 participants, forming one continuous fire dragon — the township office needed to provide a coherent narrative to the spectacle. Elders can still remember that it was originally to repair Beipu’s severed “dragon vein”, referring to mountain ridges that carry auspicious energy from a “dragon lair” or meridian spot to the town.

“Prosperity can come through a dragon vein in many forms, including wealth, a flourishing population or a successful career in politics,” Citien Temple director Chiang Jui-chin says.
Chiang adds that the original temple was built on the vein in the 1830s, and the current settlement formed around it.
Through field research, organizers concluded that Japanese colonizers had cut the vein by building a straight road between the temple and the mountain to suppress the fortunes of the influential Chiang family. Chiang Jui-chin says this act led to the decline of Beipu — and many sons in the Chiang clan to die young. After the Japanese defeat in 1945, a geomancer instructed the townspeople to walk up the mountain in a queue holding torches on the 15th day of the Lunar New Year to rejuvenate the town, and the practice has continued ever since.

“Fire is considered prosperous, so it’s able to reconnect the vein,” Chiang says. “But back then, 50 or 60 years ago, we weren’t trying to form dragons, we were just having fun running all over the hills with our torches. Since there were no tall buildings then, you could see from afar little fire dragons zipping all over the mountain.”
SLEEPING TIGER
There were just a few fireworks set off on Saturday before the crowd traveled up the hill, but no firecrackers could be heard. That’s because this particular dragon lair is shaped like a sleeping tiger and must not be disturbed, Chiang says.
Chiang says that during the Lunar New Year in 1907, the Chiang family broke the taboo by holding a raucous celebration in front of the temple. That November, the Beipu Uprising against the Japanese broke out, and eventually the rebels fled into the surrounding mountains. The Japanese troops threatened to slaughter the entire town’s inhabitants if they couldn’t catch the insurgents, and it cost the Chiangs and other local elites a lot of money and pleading to prevent a massacre.
“That’s why the stage is always down the road when we hold major religious events,” Chiang says. “That way, the gods can see it, but the tiger can’t hear it.”
When asked if the thousands of people walking up the mountain would disturb the tiger, Chiang replies: “[They] aren’t loud enough.”

The bamboo torch festival has become increasingly well-organized and attended since the Beipu Township Office took over in 2019. Tourists now sign up weeks in advance, and volunteers on site help enthusiastic visitors construct the torch, which is made by pouring oil into the bamboo’s center and stuffing the top with a roll of spirit paper.
Television host Hsu Tzu-yen, a mainstay at festivals in this area, is animatedly providing over-the-top commentary and directing the crowd, while modern fire dancers strut their stuff on stage.
The whole temple plaza is lit up, and a temple official carries the “mother flame” to the main stage where local leaders — including Chuang — ignite their torches. The fire is then passed through the crowd, torch-to-torch, until a mosaic of orange dots cover the entire area. Then they march, along with participants from nine surrounding villages, up a concrete footpath into the hills.

CHANGING TIMES
This spectacle didn’t exist when Chuang and Chiang were growing up, as organizations and families would head up on their own. Most families owned bamboo torches anyway, Chiang says, and it was mostly the boys who would carry them while the girls brought lanterns. At one point, adults placed treasures in the mountains for the children to hunt.
“What’s curious is that even though the town used to consist of mostly wooden buildings, there’s never been a fire due to this ritual as far as I can remember,” Chiang says.
Since the turn of the century, various groups in town, including the business association, have tried their hand at turning the practice into a local attraction. Chiang says they enjoyed considerable success in the early 2000s, but later stopped due to funding issues. Efforts restarted in the mid-2010s, and according to the Liberty Times (Taipei Times’ sister paper), the 2018 event attracted about 400 participants.
The “mother flame” part was devised in 2019 by the township office to create more of a sense of ceremony, Chuang says. Having the village leaders receive the flame on stage symbolizes the unity across the township, while passing it to tourists from the center to the periphery represents continuing the spirit of prosperity and the strength to protect one’s home and country, he says.
It’s not completely invented, Chuang says, as there used to be a continuously burning flame in the temple, but it was extinguished due to its designation as a historic building.
Chuang also provides evidence for the Japanese cutting the dragon vein: in addition to elders mentioning “repairing the vein,” he says the straight road behind the temple unnaturally cuts off a crucial part of its “dragon spirit.” There are many instances of people destroying dragon lairs or veins throughout history, and the Japanese had good reason to fear the Chiang family, especially since one member, Chiang Shao-tzu, led a fierce resistance against their occupation in 1895.
“These stories were only passed down orally and there isn’t a complete record of it, but after organizing all the information we found, it makes a lot of sense,” Chuang says.

"Repairing a dragon vein with fire.

In an extraordinary event that blends mythology with groundbreaking environmental science, experts are taking a bold step to restore an ancient geothermal energy source—dubbed a ""dragon vein""—using fire. This dramatic operation aims to heal a critical fault line in Earth’s crust while tapping into its vast potential as a renewable energy reservoir.

What is a Dragon Vein?

""Dragon vein"" is a term borrowed from ancient lore, where it referred to powerful, life-giving energy pathways running through the Earth. In modern geoscience, the phrase has been reimagined to describe regions of intense geothermal activity, where underground heat flows along fault lines and volcanic systems. These veins are not only sources of geothermal energy but also critical to maintaining local ecological balance.

""In many ways, these veins are the lifeblood of our planet’s energy systems,"" says Dr. Ignatius Flare, a geothermal scientist and project lead. ""When they become blocked or disrupted, it can destabilize ecosystems and diminish their energy output.""

The Problem

The dragon vein in question lies beneath a volcanic region in Iceland, renowned for its geysers and hot springs. However, recent seismic activity caused a collapse in the subterranean pathways that channel geothermal heat to the surface. As a result, several nearby geysers have gone dormant, and the surrounding wildlife has been affected by the sudden cooling of natural hot springs.

The Fiery Solution

To repair the vein, scientists are employing a technique known as ""controlled thermal fracturing."" The process involves using intense, targeted heat—essentially controlled bursts of fire—to re-melt and reforge the geological pathways. Specialized equipment, including flame torches capable of reaching temperatures exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius, has been deployed deep into the Earth’s crust.

""Fire, in this context, acts as both a scalpel and a healer,"" explains Dr. Flare. ""By carefully applying heat, we can create new channels for energy flow, effectively restoring the vein’s function.""

The Risks and Rewards

The operation is not without risks. There’s the possibility of triggering unintended seismic activity or overheating the surrounding rock formations, potentially causing fissures. However, the rewards are immense. Successfully repairing the dragon vein could:

Restore lost geothermal energy output, providing renewable energy to thousands of homes.

Revive dormant geysers and hot springs, reinvigorating local tourism.

Stabilize ecosystems that rely on geothermal heat for survival.

""This project could set a precedent for how we approach geothermal repair and sustainable energy development,"" says environmental engineer Sophie Emberstone.

A Symbolic Undertaking

For many, the project carries symbolic weight. The image of ""repairing a dragon vein with fire"" evokes myths of ancient dragons and the fiery force of nature they represent. It’s a reminder of humanity’s evolving relationship with Earth’s raw, elemental power—one that requires both respect and ingenuity.

Looking Ahead

The operation is expected to take several weeks, with the team closely monitoring seismic and thermal activity throughout the process. If successful, this daring initiative could pave the way for future repairs of geothermal systems around the world.

As the flames roar deep beneath the Earth’s surface, one can only imagine the mythical dragon stirring—not in anger, but in gratitude for humanity’s bold and fiery act of restoration.

"80-year-old Pardeeville man found guilty of staging longtime girlfriend's death.

PORTAGE, Wis. (WKOW) -- A Columbia County jury found a Pardeeville man guilty of first-degree intentional homicide in his longtime girlfriend's death. 

A judge convicted Larry Manthe, 80, in the 2022 death of Alice Langer, 76, after the jury deliberated for a total of nearly 14 hours on Thursday and Friday. 

The trial lasted for five days, including deliberations. 

Langer was found on Oct. 6, 2022 in the shower of the home where she and Manthe lived with a handgun on her lap and a gunshot wound to the left side of her head.

Her death was originally ruled a suicide until the medical examiner said the gunpowder burns on her body discovered during the autopsy was not normally seen in suicides. 

Prosecutors argued Manthe staged Langer's death. His DNA was found on the gun and ammunition. 

A first-degree intentional homicide conviction comes with an automatic life in prison sentence in the state of Wisconsin. A judge will decide at sentencing if Manthe will ever be eligible to apply for extended supervision.

"80-year-old Pardeeville man found guilty of staging longtime girlfriend's death.

Pardeeville, WI — An 80-year-old man from Pardeeville has been found guilty of staging the death of his longtime girlfriend, bringing a shocking conclusion to a case that has gripped the small Wisconsin community.

The Columbia County Circuit Court jury deliberated for six hours before convicting Harold J. McKenzie on charges of first-degree intentional homicide and obstruction of justice. The verdict comes nearly two years after the death of 76-year-old Martha J. Sterling, whose body was discovered in her home under circumstances initially thought to be an accident.

Sterling's death was originally ruled as a fall down the stairs. However, suspicions arose when forensic evidence, inconsistencies in McKenzie's statements, and a subsequent autopsy pointed to foul play. Prosecutors alleged that McKenzie carefully staged the scene to make it appear as though Sterling’s death was accidental, motivated by financial gain and long-standing disputes in their decades-long relationship.

### The Crime Scene
Authorities were called to Sterling’s home on October 14, 2022, where they found her at the base of a staircase. McKenzie, who lived with Sterling, claimed he had found her there after returning home from running errands. But investigators noted early on that the injuries Sterling sustained were inconsistent with a fall.

""The evidence told a different story,"" said District Attorney Karen Adler during closing arguments. ""The bruises on Ms. Sterling's body, the lack of defensive wounds, and the blood spatter patterns were clear indications that this was no accident.""

### Key Evidence
The prosecution presented compelling forensic evidence, including blood patterns that suggested Sterling had been struck multiple times before being placed at the foot of the stairs. Additionally, financial records revealed McKenzie had been under significant financial strain, with mounting debts and a lapsed life insurance policy on Sterling set to benefit him.

Witnesses also testified about the couple's tumultuous relationship, with neighbors reporting frequent arguments. A forensic analysis of McKenzie’s phone uncovered internet searches related to “staging an accident” and “pushing someone down stairs” just weeks before Sterling’s death.

### The Defense’s Argument
McKenzie's defense team argued that Sterling's death was a tragic accident, emphasizing her age and health issues. They also suggested that McKenzie's internet searches were unrelated and coincidental. “The prosecution has built a circumstantial case on assumptions and speculation,” defense attorney Mark Hargrove said during the trial.

However, McKenzie’s inconsistent accounts during police interviews and his lack of emotion following Sterling's death raised further doubts among jurors.

### Community Reaction
The trial drew significant attention in Pardeeville, a town of just over 2,000 residents. Many were stunned by the allegations against McKenzie, who was described by acquaintances as a quiet and polite man.

“I’ve known Harold for years, and I just can’t believe he’d do something like this,” said longtime friend Robert Kessler. “But I guess you never really know someone.”

Others, however, felt justice was served. “Martha deserved better,” said Nancy Walters, a friend of Sterling. “She was a kind and loving person, and she trusted him.”

### Sentencing Scheduled
McKenzie faces life in prison without the possibility of parole. His sentencing is scheduled for February 15, 2025. Meanwhile, Sterling's family expressed relief at the verdict but also grief over the loss of their loved one.

“We’ve waited a long time for justice,” Sterling’s niece, Linda Carrington, said outside the courtroom. “Nothing can bring Aunt Martha back, but at least we know the truth.”

The case serves as a grim reminder of how even the quietest communities can harbor dark secrets, leaving Pardeeville residents to grapple with the unsettling reality behind Sterling's tragic death.","Generate a news article with the given news title. As real as possible

"Stock market today: Dow plunges 697 points after jobs report hits rate-cut bets.

US stocks plunged on Friday after a strong December jobs report dashed investor hopes of more interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year.

The Dow Jones plunged 697 points, while the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 declined more than 1%.

The economy added 256,000 jobs in December, well above the average economist estimate of 155,000. The unemployment rate unexpectedly declined to 4.1% from 4.2% in November.
The strong jobs report sparked a surge in bond yields, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging to its highest level since October 2023, hitting an intraday high of 4.79%.

Markets now expect just one 25-basis point interest rate cut from the Fed this year, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, but economists think even that projection is too rosy.

""Given a resilient labor market, we now think the Fed cutting cycle is over. Inflation is stuck above target and risks are skewed to the upside. Economic activity is robust. We see little reason for additional easing,"" economists at Bank of America said in a Friday note.

Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel backed up that view in an interview with CNBC on Friday.

""I think really the market is saying maybe no rate cuts in 2025, and that the 10-year could very easily break well above 5%,"" Siegel said.

Siegel highlighted that higher bond yields have historically pulled down stock market valuations, so it would be no surprise for the stock market to experience a correction this year.",https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/stock-market-today-dow-plunges-697-points-after-jobs-report-hits-rate-cut-bets/ar-BB1rfwxY?ocid=msedgntp&pc=HCTS&cvid=c9045345ca1c485fa8816f4cafa660ae&ei=40,real,0
"Stock market today: Dow plunges 697 points after jobs report hits rate-cut bets.

October 6, 2023 — Wall Street experienced a sharp selloff today as investors reacted to a stronger-than-expected jobs report, which dampened hopes for near-term interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 697 points, or 2.1%, marking its worst single-day decline since March. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also tumbled, dropping 1.9% and 2.3%, respectively, as markets recalibrated expectations for monetary policy.

The Labor Department’s September jobs report revealed that the U.S. economy added 336,000 jobs, nearly double the 170,000 forecasted by economists. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.8%, while wage growth moderated slightly, rising 0.2% month-over-month and 4.2% year-over-year. The robust hiring figures surprised investors, who had been betting on a cooling labor market to prompt the Federal Reserve to ease its tight monetary policy stance.

""The market was caught off guard by the sheer strength of the jobs report,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG. ""This level of job creation suggests the economy is still running hot, which complicates the Fed's fight against inflation. Investors are now reassessing the likelihood of rate cuts in the near future.""

The report sent Treasury yields soaring, with the 10-year yield climbing to 4.85%, its highest level since 2007. Higher yields pressured equity markets, particularly rate-sensitive sectors like technology and real estate. The Nasdaq, heavily weighted toward tech stocks, bore the brunt of the selloff, with giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet each falling more than 2%.

The S&P 500 saw broad-based declines, with all 11 sectors finishing in the red. Financials and industrials were among the hardest hit, as rising yields raised concerns about borrowing costs and economic growth. The Dow’s decline was led by losses in Boeing, Goldman Sachs, and Caterpillar, all of which dropped more than 3%.

Market participants had been hoping that signs of economic softening would prompt the Federal Reserve to pause its rate-hiking campaign and potentially cut rates in early 2024. However, the strong jobs data has cast doubt on that scenario. Fed officials have repeatedly emphasized their commitment to bringing inflation down to their 2% target, and today’s report suggests the labor market remains resilient despite higher borrowing costs.

""The Fed’s job just got harder,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. ""With employment growth this strong, inflationary pressures could persist, forcing the central bank to keep rates higher for longer. That’s not what the market wanted to hear.""

The CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, which tracks market expectations for interest rate moves, showed a sharp decline in the probability of a rate cut in the first half of 2024. Futures markets now price in a greater chance of another rate hike before the end of the year.

As investors digest the implications of the jobs report, volatility is expected to remain elevated in the coming weeks. The next major test for markets will be the release of September’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which will provide further insight into the inflation trajectory.

For now, the message from Wall Street is clear: the path to a soft landing for the economy is fraught with uncertainty, and the Fed’s battle against inflation is far from over.","write a news article about Write a news article with tittle ""Stock market today: Dow plunges 697 points after jobs report hits rate-cut bets"" about a significant drop in the stock market following the release of an unexpected economic report.

"SD County Supervisors OK American Airlines lease at Carlsbad Field.

The San Diego County Board of Supervisors has approved a lease agreement that will let American Airlines begin daily flights from the airport in Carlsbad, it was announced Thursday.

Supervisors on Wednesday voted unanimously in favor of the two-year lease at McClellan-Palomar Airport, one of eight operated by the county's Department of Public Works.

The lease will allow American Airlines to operate a duel-engine Embraer 175 jet with the first departure starting at 6:15 a.m. to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.

Jamie Abbott, county airports director, said resuming commercial flights will mean possibly 150 additional jobs.

It costs $7 million annually to operate the airport, which supports 2,600 jobs, and generates $420 million in industry activity and $72 million in tax revenue, Abbott told supervisors during a presentation.

""Resuming commercial service will bolster the economic impact for the region and help insure critical ongoing financial commitment from the (Federal Aviation Administration),"" he said.

Abbott said that letting American Airlines begin flights in Carlsbad would give people another option, rather than commuting to San Diego International or airports in other counties, such as Los Angeles.

The Palomar Airport Advisory Committee has also recommended approval, he added.

United Express stopped flights at the airport in 2015 after 20 years of service, Abbott said.

Abbott told supervisors that the county is required by law to negotiate in good faith with service providers wishing to lease space, or risk losing future FAA grants or possibly having to repay previous grants.

County staff recommend a first-year fee waiver of $351,428, reducing revenue to $255,250, according to information on the meeting agenda. In the second year, the county will receive $606,678 in revenue.

Abbott said the county will take steps to alleviate noise concerns, including installing monitors.

Armed law enforcement officers will be on-site during flight departure times, as required by the federal Transportation Security Administration.

During a public comment period, supporters touted the benefits of American Airlines having flights out of the Carlsbad airport, which was first opened in 1959.

Olivier Brackett, former McClellan-Palomar manager, said that almost every day staff would receive calls from local residents inquiring about commercial service demonstrating a great need and desire.

""We had to purchase a bike rack because some people rode their bicycle with a backpack to the airport to catch a flight,"" Brackett said. ""Never saw that one coming.""

Phyllis Trombi of the Gillespie Field Development Council said people nearby will hear the airplane taking off for less than a minute at 38 decibels. She added that snoring has a decibel level of between 50 and 80, for example.

A Carlsbad-based pilot said those not in favor ""are the loud minority.""

""Commercial air service available to all of North County is good for all of North County,"" he added.

Opponents cited concerns ranging from noise to air quality.

Hope Nelson, of Citizens for a Friendly Airport, said American Airlines refuses to abide by noise abatement and is under no obligation to avoid flight paths over homes.

A Carlsbad woman said residents opposed to commercial flights out the airport were blamed for moving into area, but ""many of us have lived there for decades, and shouldn't be forced out by an apathetic group of non-residents and an ineptly run airport mired in overreach and grants they accepted.""

Corinna Contreras, a member of the Vista City Council, said the council passed a resolution stating that it is ""not in favor of moving forward with these commercial flights.""

Contreras said she has seen an increase in flights out of the airport, along with a lot of environmental issues that haven't been fixed.

Supervisor Terra Lawson said she was upset about having to approve the agreement, given the terms.

""I feel like we basically have a gun to our head, but the FAA is saying, `Take this deal or we're gonna take like somewhere between $5 million and $150 million of your money and sue you,""' Lawson-Remer, board vice chair.

"SD County Supervisors OK American Airlines lease at Carlsbad Field.

Carlsbad, CA — The San Diego County Board of Supervisors has voted in favor of a new lease agreement with American Airlines at the McClellan-Palomar Airport in Carlsbad, signaling a major step forward for both the region's aviation industry and its local economy. The lease, which was approved during a meeting on Tuesday, will allow American Airlines to expand its operations at the regional airport, enhancing connectivity for travelers in North County.

The agreement grants American Airlines the right to lease a 5-acre parcel of land at the airport for the next 10 years, with the possibility of extending the lease. The space will be used for a variety of purposes, including the construction of a new operations center, additional parking for aircraft, and facilities for ground services. The lease is expected to bring more jobs to the area and provide greater convenience for passengers traveling through the airport, which has long been a popular hub for regional flights.

“This is a critical investment in both the future of McClellan-Palomar Airport and the broader Carlsbad community,” said Supervisor Jim Desmond, who represents North County. “American Airlines’ expanded presence here will not only improve air travel options for residents and visitors, but also create new economic opportunities and strengthen our region’s transportation infrastructure.”

A Growing Hub for North County
McClellan-Palomar Airport, located about 30 miles north of downtown San Diego, has seen a steady increase in passenger traffic over the past few years. The airport, which primarily serves commercial flights to major hubs such as Phoenix and Dallas, has long been considered a critical part of the transportation network for North County residents who want to avoid the congestion and distance associated with San Diego International Airport.

American Airlines, which already operates out of Carlsbad’s McClellan-Palomar, will now be able to expand its footprint at the airport, offering more flight options and potentially increasing the number of daily flights in and out of the region. The airline has expressed confidence that the lease will help meet the growing demand for air travel in Southern California, particularly as the North County population continues to grow.

“We’re excited to deepen our commitment to the Carlsbad area and its residents,” said Laura Wright, Senior Vice President of American Airlines. “This new lease agreement is a testament to our belief in the region’s potential, and we look forward to offering more direct routes and an improved customer experience at McClellan-Palomar Airport.”

Economic Impact and Job Creation
The new lease agreement is expected to have a positive economic impact on Carlsbad and the surrounding areas. Along with the construction of new facilities, American Airlines’ expanded presence is expected to generate hundreds of new jobs, ranging from airport ground crew to administrative and customer service positions. Local businesses, including hotels, restaurants, and retail outlets, are also expected to benefit from an increase in airport activity.

“This lease is a win for Carlsbad residents, local businesses, and visitors alike,” said Carlsbad Mayor Matt Hall. “The expansion of American Airlines’ operations will not only improve air service, but also contribute to the long-term economic health of our region.”

Looking to the Future
The approval of the American Airlines lease comes as the county continues to explore ways to further enhance the capacity and functionality of McClellan-Palomar Airport. Over the next decade, the airport is expected to undergo significant upgrades, including the construction of a new terminal and improvements to the runways and taxiways.

In addition to American Airlines’ new lease, officials are also working to attract other airlines to the airport to diversify the region’s travel options. The county has emphasized the importance of growing North County’s aviation sector in tandem with population growth, with an eye toward sustaining the area's position as a transportation hub.

“We’re looking ahead at a future where McClellan-Palomar is a key part of our region’s connectivity,” said Supervisor Desmond. “This agreement is just one piece of the puzzle, and we’re excited to see where this growth takes us.”

The new lease agreement is set to go into effect next month, with construction of the new facilities expected to begin later this year.",You are a newpaper writer. You are tasked to generate a news article with the title SD County Supervisors OK American Airlines lease at Carlsbad Field. ,fake,1

"Citizens raise concerns to county’s General Assembly delegation.

This past weekend, about 80 residents streamed into the Board Auditorium of the Fairfax County Government Center to voice their concerns to the Fairfax County delegation to the General Assembly, days before the start of the 2025 legislative session.

The topics were wide-ranging, covering subjects including K-12 education, pedestrian safety, developmental disabilities, voting rights, childcare, housing, poverty, nutrition, aging, taxes, clean energy, transportation, drug laws, a proposed casino in Tysons, gun violence, suicide prevention, advocacy on behalf of Black women and girls, school security, data centers, a meals tax, homeschooling, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s budget proposal, psychiatry, reproductive rights, maternal healthcare, the justice system, healthcare, air quality in schools, teaching salaries, and more topics.

The public hearing underscores the importance of civic responsibility and how governments can work to serve the people. It is a historical tradition dating back to ancient Athenian democracy, where citizens would gather before government officials to speak on policy issues, emphasizing the importance of public discourse before the government. 

The hearing was televised on Fairfax County Television Channel 16. 

The Virginia General Assembly is the legislative body of the Commonwealth of Virginia. It includes the state Senate and the House of Delegates. The 2025 legislative session started on Jan. 8 in Richmond.

The Fairfax County delegation includes 22 lawmakers, all members of the Democratic Party. Seven lawmakers are representatives to the Virginia Senate. They are: Jennifer Carroll Foy (D, 33rd District, Woodbridge), Scott A. Surovell (D, 34th District, Mt. Vernon), David W. Marsden (D, 35th District, Burke), Stella G. Pekarsky (D, 36th District, Centreville), Saddam Azlan Salim (D, 37th District, Merrifield), Jennifer B. Boysko (D, 38th District, Herndon), and Adam P. Ebbin (D, 39th District, Alexandria).

It includes 15 lawmakers in the Virginia House of Delegates. They include: Charniele L. Herring (D, 4th District, Alexandria), Richard C. “Rip” Sullivan, Jr. (D, 6th District, McLean), Karen Keys-Gamarra (D, 7th District, Oakton), Irene Shin (D, 8th District, Herndon), Karrie K. Delaney (D, 9th District, Centreville), Dan I. Helmer (D, District 10, Clifton), David L. Bulova (D, District 11, Fairfax Station), Holly M. Seibold (D, District 12, Vienna), Marcus B. Simon (D, District 13, Falls Church), Vivian Watts (D, District 14, Annandale), Laura Jane H. Cohen (D, District 15, Burke), Paul E. Krizek (D, District 16, Alexandria), Mark D. Sickles (D, District 17, Franconia), Kathy KL Tran (D, District 18, Springfield), and Rozia A. “J.R.” Henson, Jr. (D, District 19, Richmond). 

Several speakers raised concerns about increasing K-12 funding, noting that recession-era cost reduction measures are still in effect but that this formula does not account for higher-need students. 

Funding K-12 education

Melanie Meren, a Fairfax County School Board member, urged the General Assembly to address school underfunding. She noted that the governor’s proposed budget needs to be adjusted and that additional funds are necessary to protect early childhood education. 

Arthur Purves, president of the Fairfax County Taxpayers Alliance, believes competition improves schools more than money. He advises lawmakers not to increase school funding until schools improve their curriculum. 

FCPS teacher Lauren Paz Soldan asked the delegation to invest in teachers. She said that “our job is taxing.” To her, teachers need to be paid what they “deserve.” She concluded, saying that “our working conditions are student’s learning conditions.” Another FCPS teacher, Abigail Quinn, argued that teachers are so underpaid they cannot even “afford homes.” 

Supporting people with disabilities 

At the hearing, several speakers also advocated for more support for people with developmental disabilities. One speaker, John Kelly, who spoke on behalf of a family member, praised the developmental disability programs in Virginia, noting that they give “daily meaning and purpose.” 

However, many speakers discussed the shortcomings of those with disabilities. Conner Cummings, an advocate for disability rights, said that people with disabilities face injustices when it comes to their voting rights. 

Dennis Findley, chair of the Virginia Board of People with Disabilities, said that just because an individual is an “incapacitated person, like my son,” doesn’t mean they are “incompetent” and “do not get to vote.” 

Cummings also urged lawmakers to continue improving waiver rates and allowing people with disabilities to keep their waivers and still work. Waivers support community-based alternatives to institutional care funded by the state. They provide medical care and enable employment, community living, behavioral intervention, and other benefits. 

Rose Risley, a member of the Coordinating Council on Aging and Adults with Disabilities, raised concerns about a lack of affordable housing for the elderly and those with disabilities and advocated for high-quality, “person-centered” community care. She also asked for protections that would eliminate evictions of the elderly and those with disabilities. 

Melissa Chabot, a special education advocate, also raised concerns about behavioral problems that people with autism can experience when they are in a crisis and pushed for a permanent autism commission so that people with autism get the resources they need. 

Fixing a County ‘housing and child-care crisis’

Michele Menapace, a Fairfax County Community Action Advisory Board member, spoke about child care. She said that parents face “out-of-reach” child-care expenses. “Working families are not able to afford necessities,” she said. The “harsh reality” is a substantial dearth of childcare availability to her. 

Heather Thomas, also a Community Action Advisory Board member, said the county faces a “housing and child-care crisis.” She noted that infant child care is unaffordable for most Virginians. Her board colleague, Michelle Jefferson, also urged lawmakers to address affordable housing, child care, and food security, stating that “robust support” should be provided for programs that increase nutritious food availability.

Addressing environmental concerns

Energy issues also emerged at the public hearing. Bryan Scrafford, advocacy director of the Faith Alliance for Climate Solutions, emphasized the importance of “solar energy” and “electrical energy” and said he is working on a bill with state Sen. Rip Sullivan to create a “carbon-free energy environment” that will “reduce dependence on carbon fuel.” 

Ken Sandler, the chair of the Fairfax County Democratic Party’s environmental committee, said, “data centers are growing with massive energy use,” jeopardizing clean energy efforts. He called on lawmakers to reexamine tax breaks for data centers and set clean energy standards.

Speakers also discussed the hot topic of the proposed casino in Tysons. Connie Hartke, a member of the Reston Citizens Association, said that casinos decrease property values and that Fairfax County deserves more than uncertain revenues. McLean resident Sally Horn, a leader in a coalition, National Security Leaders for Fairfax, noted that gambling addiction is a problem that “affects national security officials.” She also said that casinos create a “fertile ground” for “adversarial intelligence personnel.” 

Raising concern about a new casino

Jennifer Falcone, a Great Falls Citizens Association member, said that a casino is not the “cure” for budgetary problems. 

Paula Martino, a member of the Tysons Stakeholders Alliance, said that living a few blocks from the proposed site left residents at “ground zero.” According to Martino, tax revenue from casinos “slows and declines” over time, warning that casinos “cannibalize local business” and are “linked to lower employment growth.”

The public hearing lasted almost four hours and explored various topics. ",https://www.fairfaxtimes.com/articles/citizens-raise-concerns-to-county-s-general-assembly-delegation/article_30dc17a2-cec4-11ef-b6e4-a3579a33da32.html,real,0

"Brewster sheriff shoots out tire of fleeing theft suspect.

ALPINE — Brewster County Sheriff Ronny Dodson shot a fleeing theft suspect’s rear tire as he fled from deputies through Alpine west on Highway 90 on December 27 before the suspect’s car ran over tire spikes, collided with another vehicle and ultimately came to rest.

Arrested was Justin Gabriel Cristales, 26 of Mississippi, for evading arrest with a motor vehicle, a third-degree felony, according to a probable cause affidavit from the sheriff’s office.

According to the arrest affidavit, Brewster County Deputy Ismael Hernandez was patrolling the intersection of Highways 90 and 67 after receiving information that a suspect had stolen items from the Alon gas station in Marathon and was headed toward Alpine.  

“According to the caller, an unknown individual walked out of the store with several items, and stated “I won’t be paying for this s___!” the sheriff’s department wrote on its Facebook page. Hernandez spotted the vehicle around 12:23 p.m. and tried to initiate a stop, but Cristales refused to pull over. “Cristales drove on the incoming lane of travel and placed drivers on the highway in danger,” he wrote in the affidavit. “I called in a pursuit via radio and multiple units joined and assisted with the pursuit.”

Cristales then avoided “stop sticks” placed in his path and intended to deflate his tires three times, Hernandez wrote. “Approximately 4 miles West of Alpine, Sheriff Dodson disabled the rear tire of the vehicle with a well placed round from his 1911 pistol,” the Facebook post stated.

“The vehicle’s tires were deflating, however Cristales kept fleeing, driving his vehicle all over the highway, placing units and other drivers on the road at risk,” the affidavit stated. “Sheriff Ronny Dodson conducted a pit maneuver which resulted in Cristales’s vehicle impacting another vehicle which was traveling Eastbound on U.S 90. After a felony stop where Cristales’s windows had to be shattered due to his non-compliant behavior Cristales was safely placed in custody and was transported to the Brewster County Jail.”

A pit maneuver is a technique used by law enforcement that uses a patrol car to bump into a fleeing vehicle’s back quarter panel causing it to spin out of control and hopefully come to rest. The passengers in the car that Cristale’s vehicle hit after losing control as a result of the pit maneuver were not injured, Hernandez wrote in the affidavit.

Gilda Gonzales, owner of the Alon station in Marathon, said that she was not there when the alleged theft occurred but that her staff reported that an individual not only refused to pay but also laughed as he did it. She said she was unsure what was stolen, but it was something minor.

“If someone needs something, I’m ready to help them,” she said Sunday. “But this person just took it and laughed at us.” Gonzales said that the only reason the crime was even reported was because of the attitude of the man taking the items.

“Cristales was not able to provide me with a clear reason of his purpose in the area,” Hernandez wrote in the affidavit. “Cristales did admit to me to have taken a Gatorade from the Alon gas station.”

Hundreds of commenters on the sheriff department’s Facebook post (and on other pages) lauded the sheriff for his sharpshooting and for the department’s “hard on crime” stance. Some, however, questioned the safety of enjoining in a high-speed chase through the city for a minor theft. 

The department’s Facebook post also included a description of the event with numerous hashtags like “#comeonvacation #leaveonprobation #whatwashethinking #thisisTexas,” which drew praise from commenters.

The affidavit stated that Cristales told officers he has post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and significant mental health issues as a result of serving in the military.",https://bigbendsentinel.com/2025/01/08/brewster-sheriff-shoots-out-tire-of-fleeing-theft-suspect-2/,real,0
"Brewster sheriff shoots out tire of fleeing theft suspect.

BREWSTER, Texas — A dramatic police pursuit in Brewster ended abruptly yesterday evening when Sheriff Thomas Connelly disabled a fleeing suspect’s vehicle by shooting out its rear tire. The incident unfolded shortly after 6:00 p.m. when deputies responded to a reported theft at a local hardware store.

According to eyewitnesses, the suspect—identified by authorities as 28-year-old Victor Coleman—sped away from the store’s parking lot in a blue sedan after allegedly stealing several power tools. Sheriff Connelly, who was in the vicinity, joined responding deputies in a brief chase that wound through several residential streets.

When Coleman refused to pull over and nearly collided with other vehicles, Sheriff Connelly made the split-second decision to fire at the fleeing car’s tire. The shot successfully punctured the rear passenger-side tire, causing the suspect’s vehicle to fishtail and come to a stop near the intersection of Walnut Drive and Main Street.

No injuries were reported during the incident. Coleman surrendered immediately after his car was immobilized and was taken into custody without further resistance. Officers recovered the stolen tools in the sedan’s trunk and returned them to the store.

Sheriff Connelly told reporters that resorting to shooting out a tire is “always a last measure,” but added that the suspect’s erratic driving and disregard for public safety made it a necessary course of action. Coleman faces charges of theft, evading arrest, and reckless endangerment.

Authorities say the investigation is ongoing, and no further statements have been released at this time.

"Cupertino school board candidate’s probable election leaves some LGBTQ families anxious.

As one Cupertino Union School District candidate inches toward a win, alarm bells are sounding among LGBTQ+ advocates worried about his stance on inclusive curriculum.

Parent Long Jiao’s apparent second-place finish for one of the two open seats on the five-person school board has families worried about what it could mean for queer students and faculty. Jiao has about 21.1% of the vote as of Thursday, behind top vote-getter and sitting board member Sylvia Leong with about 35.9%. Lakshmi Sharma is trailing Jiao, with about 19.3% of the vote.

Votes are still being tallied, but some community members said Jiao’s lead is troubling because of his alignment with Curriculum Integrity — a parent group whose concerns over gender identity and queer topics in the classroom led to the investigation of a nonbinary transitional kindergarten teacher. The teacher, who San José Spotlight chose not to name over safety concerns, is on leave while the investigation determines whether they went beyond district-approved curriculum by having a poster with different pronouns and a book showing boys wearing skirts.

Jiao said curriculum should be similar in classrooms across the district, which serves about 13,500 students. He wants parents to have the opportunity to opt in and out of “experimental” teaching that goes beyond district curriculum, similar to opting in or out of sex education in fifth and seventh grade.

Jiao said he stands out from other candidates because of his willingness to stand up for what he believes, even when he is in the minority. He said inclusivity is good, but the best way to include all students is to hang the American flag and avoid mentioning different identities entirely because it’s difficult to include everything.

“If the teachers just stick to (the curriculum) without engaging their personal beliefs, it’s actually the most inclusive thing because all the students, no matter which culture they come from and no matter which background they come from, they can be accepted and not feel alienated,” he told San José Spotlight.

If elected, Jiao would likely represent the minority opinion on the board and have little power during votes, outgoing board President Phyllis Vogel said. She added it would be difficult to allow parents to opt out of queer topics because subjects like gender identity and expression come up naturally, without a start and end date like sex education.

But Jiao’s potential to take the seat is still worrying to parents like Robb Zimmerman, who has a nonbinary child in the district. He said representation like Jiao’s can cause damage to queer students and faculty. Zimmerman is working on building community to help protect his child in anticipation of Jiao’s win.

“It takes nothing more than some political savvy to preside from a minority position (to cause hurt),” he told San José Spotlight. “Even if he’s the lone voice he might bring out some sympathies of people on the board, who were maybe on the fence or had some concerns, but didn’t feel like those concerns would be heard.”

“If the teachers just stick to (the curriculum) without engaging their personal beliefs, it’s actually the most inclusive thing because all the students … can be accepted and not feel alienated.”

Long Jiao, school board candidate
The battle over LGBTQ-inclusive materials in the classroom has erupted over the past few months with the nonbinary teacher placed on leave, as swarms of parents, teachers and Cupertino Educators Association members attend board meetings to voice their opinions. The contention led to a board discussion about Board Policy 6144, which sets guidelines for discussing controversial topics. The district has no comprehensive policies on LGBTQ+ curriculum outside of its sexual education units.

The Cupertino Educators Association wants clearer guidelines on queer topics so groups like Curriculum Integrity have a harder time questioning their place in the classroom. The union endorsed Leong and Sharma. A union statement said it’s optimistic about the final results.

“We are hopeful that moving forward, the CUSD board will take action on our consistent demands to explicitly protect and support our LGBTQ students and teachers, and to protect and support our use of California Department of Education recommended materials and methods,” a union spokesperson told San José Spotlight.

Agreeing to disagree

Santa Clara County must certify the election results to the state by Dec. 5.

Vogel, who’s leaving the board after 17 years, said the board has a protocol outlining that members who vote in the minority should support the final outcome, no matter if they personally disagree. She wants that to continue with the new board.

“We’ve been very good listeners to public opinion and I hope that continues,” she told San José Spotlight. “I would like to see the whole inclusivity (message), that whole philosophy be strengthened.”",https://localnewsmatters.org/2024/11/20/cupertino-school-board-candidates-probable-election-leaves-some-lgbtq-families-anxious/,real,0
"Cupertino school board candidate’s probable election leaves some LGBTQ families anxious.

In Cupertino, California, the anticipated election of school board candidate Long Jiao has raised concerns among LGBTQ+ families regarding the future inclusivity of the Cupertino Union School District (CUSD). Jiao, who appears to have secured one of the two open seats on the five-member board, is associated with Curriculum Integrity—a parent group apprehensive about discussions of gender identity and queer topics in classrooms. 

The group's concerns recently led to the investigation of a nonbinary transitional kindergarten teacher at Dilworth Elementary School. The teacher was placed on administrative leave after displaying a poster with various pronouns and a book depicting boys wearing skirts, actions some parents deemed beyond the district-approved curriculum. 

Jiao advocates for uniformity in classroom instruction across the district, which serves approximately 13,500 students. He proposes that parents should have the option to opt in or out of teachings that extend beyond the standard curriculum, similar to existing policies for sex education in certain grades. 

This stance has prompted anxiety among LGBTQ+ advocates and families, who fear it may lead to the exclusion of queer topics from educational materials, potentially marginalizing LGBTQ+ students and staff. The Cupertino Education Association, representing district teachers, has expressed support for inclusive classrooms and the nonbinary teacher under investigation, urging the district to uphold safe and equitable learning environments for all students. 

The situation in Cupertino reflects a broader national debate over the inclusion of LGBTQ+ topics in school curricula. Similar disputes have emerged in other districts, with some school boards considering policies that would require parental notification if a student identifies as transgender—a practice critics argue could endanger vulnerable students. 

As Jiao prepares to assume his role on the school board, LGBTQ+ families and allies in Cupertino remain vigilant, advocating for policies that ensure representation and safety for all students, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.","generate a news article with the same title as the one below

"It's Head Coaching Interview Season In Foxboro: Patch Patriots Roundup.

Foxborough, MA — As the New England Patriots wrap up another season, speculation about the future of the team’s leadership has hit a fever pitch. With disappointing results on the field this year, head coaching interviews are reportedly underway, and fans are eager to see what changes might come to Foxboro.

Bill Belichick’s Future in Question
Longtime head coach Bill Belichick, who has led the Patriots to six Super Bowl victories over his storied career, finds himself under scrutiny after back-to-back seasons of underwhelming performance. While Belichick remains a legend in the NFL, questions about his ability to adapt to modern football trends have sparked debate among analysts and fans.

Insiders suggest that team owner Robert Kraft may be weighing all options, including exploring potential successors, as the organization looks to reclaim its dominance in the AFC East.

Potential Candidates for the Job
Reports indicate that several prominent coaching candidates could be in the mix if the Patriots decide to make a change. Among the names floated:

Jerod Mayo: The current Patriots linebackers coach and defensive assistant has long been considered a rising star in coaching. With deep ties to the organization, Mayo would be a natural successor to Belichick.

DeMeco Ryans: The San Francisco 49ers’ defensive coordinator has garnered praise for his innovative schemes and leadership. Ryans would bring a fresh perspective and energy to the Patriots.

Eric Bieniemy: The offensive coordinator for the Kansas City Chiefs remains one of the league’s most sought-after coaching candidates. Bieniemy’s offensive acumen could breathe new life into the Patriots’ struggling offense.

Bill O’Brien: A familiar face in New England, O’Brien’s experience as both a head coach and a Patriots assistant makes him a logical candidate if the team wants someone with ties to the Belichick coaching tree.

Fan Reactions Are Mixed
Patriots Nation is buzzing with opinions about the team’s direction. While some fans are hesitant to move on from Belichick’s proven track record, others are calling for a bold new vision to steer the franchise back to glory.

“Belichick’s legacy is undeniable, but maybe it’s time for a new chapter,” said one fan outside Gillette Stadium. “We need someone who can develop young talent and keep up with today’s fast-paced offenses.”

Others remain loyal to the legendary coach. “Bill’s been the heart and soul of this team for decades,” another fan argued. “We’ve had a rough few years, but I believe he’s still the guy to turn things around.”

Draft Decisions Loom
Beyond coaching, the Patriots are also facing a pivotal offseason for roster construction. With a top-10 draft pick on the horizon, the team has a chance to address glaring issues, particularly on offense. The quarterback position, in particular, remains a hot topic, as Mac Jones’ development has plateaued.

What’s Next for the Patriots?
As head coaching interviews and evaluations heat up, one thing is clear: the Patriots are at a crossroads. Whether they stick with the status quo or usher in a new era of leadership, the decisions made in Foxboro this offseason will have long-term implications for the franchise.

"It's Head Coaching Interview Season In Foxboro: Patch Patriots Roundup.

FOXBOROUGH, MA — Jerod Mayo's one-year stint as the head coach of the New England Patriots is over, and the Patriots have already begun the process of finding the team's next top man.

Owner Robert Kraft fired Mayo on Sunday afternoon shortly after the coach won the final game of his only season leading the team. The win saw the team end the year with a 4-13 record and also knocked them out of the first overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. They will now pick fourth, but could still have their choice of the best offensive lineman or wide receiver available to them.

Kraft, who designated Mayo as the heir apparent to Belichick, said the decision wasn't an easy one.

""For me, personally, this was one of the hardest decisions I have made,"" Kraft said in a statement late Sunday afternoon. ""I have known Jerod for 17 years. He earned my respect and admiration as a rookie in 2008 and throughout his career for his play on the field, his leadership in the locker room and the way he has conducted himself in our community.""

Still, the team has moved on quickly from the firing to the initial interview stage, having already interviewed ex-Tennessee Titans head coach Mike Vrabel, who is a member of the Patriots Hall of Fame.

The team has also completed interviews with former Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich and longtime offensive assistant Pep Hamilton.

If Vrabel is one of the top names in the coaching search, perhaps the other two most highly-valued candidates are Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn.

Johnson is set to interview with the team via Zoom on Friday while Glenn declined to interview with the Patriots.

The Athletic's Chad Graff said that the team's four-person hiring committee is expected to move quickly after interviewing its top candidates, noting that a decision is expected as early as next week.

Graff as well as plenty of other insiders, consider Vrabel as the top candidate, though Ben Johnson is considered around the league as the crown jewel of this coaching cycle.",https://patch.com/massachusetts/foxborough/its-head-coaching-interview-season-foxboro-patch-patriots-roundup,real,0
"Journey to zero emissions: one resident’s vision of a cleaner and healthier future.

In the heart of Fairfax County, a passionate resident is leading the charge towards a zero-emissions future. Jane Doe, a long-time advocate for environmental sustainability, has dedicated her life to reducing carbon footprints and promoting green living.

Jane's journey began a decade ago when she first became aware of the severe impacts of climate change. ""I realized that every small action counts,"" she recalls. ""From reducing waste to using renewable energy, I wanted to make a difference.""

Her home is a testament to her commitment. Solar panels adorn the roof, providing clean energy for her household. Inside, energy-efficient appliances and smart home technology ensure minimal energy consumption. Jane has also embraced a zero-waste lifestyle, meticulously recycling and composting to reduce landfill contributions.

But Jane's efforts extend beyond her home. She has been instrumental in community initiatives, organizing tree-planting events, and advocating for bike lanes and public transportation improvements. Her vision is to create a community where sustainable living is the norm, not the exception.

""Education is key,"" Jane emphasizes. She regularly hosts workshops and seminars, educating residents on the benefits of sustainable practices and how they can implement them in their daily lives. Her efforts have inspired many to adopt greener habits, creating a ripple effect throughout the community.

Jane's vision for a cleaner and healthier future is not just a dream; it's becoming a reality. With the support of local government and fellow residents, Fairfax County is making strides towards reducing its carbon footprint. Initiatives like increased recycling programs, renewable energy projects, and green building standards are paving the way for a sustainable future.

As Jane looks to the future, she remains optimistic. ""We have the power to change the world,"" she says with a smile. ""It starts with each one of us making a conscious effort to live sustainably. Together, we can achieve zero emissions and create a healthier planet for future generations.""","Generate a news article titled ""Journey to zero emissions: one resident’s vision of a cleaner and healthier future"" based off of the publicly available article of the same title from the Fairfax County Times.",fake,1
"Journey to zero emissions: one resident’s vision of a cleaner and healthier future.

Nestled in a Vienna neighborhood, not far from Maple Avenue, is a house adorned with rooftop panels and a homeowner with a greener future in mind.

Meet Susan Stillman, a Fairfax County resident who embarked on a mission years ago to create a solar-powered “net-zero home” that produces as much energy as it consumes. 

Stillman, a former tech saleswoman, recently invited the Fairfax County Times into her home to share her journey, which she says began with a question: “Where does our energy come from?”

Stillman asked herself this question in 2007 when she began volunteering with the Virginia chapter of the Sierra Club, a nonprofit with a mission to protect the environment and promote a healthier planet. Stillman describes joining this group as pivotal in her lifestyle shift; she began to think about how much the electric sector contributes to pollution while serving a vital purpose.


Stillman’s journey underscores a broader national conversation that Americans are having about how to be better stewards of the environment and the efforts that they are making to transition to a “cleaner” lifestyle. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a federal agency that tallies energy-related data, the average American household consumes about 10,500 kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, with a daily average consumption of about 30 kilowatt-hours.

Americans use about 52% of that energy for space heating and air conditioning. The United Nations reports that the energy supply sector accounts for 35% of global emissions.

This discovery led Stillman on a path she “never expected,” she said, sitting in her living room, resulting in a new home and a new way of life. In 2010, Stillman became involved with the Conservation and Sustainability Commission for Vienna, an organization dedicated to addressing community environmental, energy, and natural resource issues. She started running solar co-ops, where neighbors come together to buy solar panels from a single vendor, increasing their leverage as they negotiate with solar installers.

“Solar co-ops are really useful,” explained Stillman, over the meows of her three-legged cat, Chatters, sitting nearby. “You don’t have to worry about calling companies and comparing prices and terms and conditions.”

In 2015, the federal government began to offer tax credits equal to 30% of the cost and installation of residential solar electric systems made after 2009. When Stillman heard this, she jumped at the chance to begin her journey of going solar and reducing her carbon footprint.

Stillman began installing solar panels throughout her home, originally built in the 1960s so that they “covered her electrical needs.” She felt she was positively changing her lifestyle but still wanted to go further. Her journey took a turn in 2016 when she discovered her furnace was generating carbon monoxide, an invisible, deadly gas. 

“Even though I had a detector that worked properly, it made me realize how dependent my home was on fossil fuels – and just how dangerous that can be,” explained Stillman. She said that experience made her more determined to build an all-electric home free from fossil fuels, which are non-renewable energy sources, like coal, petroleum, and natural gas, used to generate heat and power while contributing to global pollution and climate change. 

“I was living in an older home with inefficient systems and outdated materials,” Stillman explained. “It wasn’t a very green space, to put it mildly, but I calculated that installing solar panels would help me do my part in reducing my contribution to electric sector pollution.”

She began to plan for a “net-zero home,” making it as “efficient and healthy” as possible, she said.

“I wanted a home where air quality was top-notch, where there would be no methane emissions or other pollutants,” said Stillman. She purchased a lot in Vienna in 2020 and began working with an architect in 2021. She broke ground in 2023, and after a year of construction, she officially moved into the house in April 2024. Her new home is all-electric, insulated, and equipped with triple-pane windows and high-efficiency systems.

A new cooktop

Her favorite feature? The induction cooktop.

Induction cooktops use electromagnetic fields to connect compatible cookware, creating electrical currents called eddy currents that generate heat. Experts consider this type of stovetop safer than conventional stovetops because it can only heat cookware magnetically connected to it. 

Stillman demonstrates this feature with a smile by heating a pot of water. The water boils in under two minutes and can cool down within seconds of lowered heat. Her induction stove triggers the energy recovery ventilator to kick in, a mechanism that recycles indoor air with fresh, cleaner outdoor air. This ventilation system primarily improves indoor air quality and reduces energy consumption by preventing her household from relying on a separate heating and cooling system.

“It is more favorable for people who have allergies,” said Stillman.

Stillman takes pride in another feature: changeable LED lighting. Energy experts have lauded LED lighting for energy efficiency for years, using 90% less energy than traditional incandescent light bulbs. Stillman, however, takes issue with the advertising methods that many manufacturers of LED lighting use.

“Most boxes say, ‘Never change a lightbulb again,’ but they are selling you integrated LEDs where you can’t change it, and you throw away the whole fixture,” Stillman explained. “We are going to have landfills full of this.”

Stillman also showcased her German-designed triple-pane windows as a welcome addition to her home, noting they have drastically improved her energy efficiency.

“American-made windows connect only in one place, and there is all this leakage,” explained Stillman. “These,” she said, motioning to her window, “connect in multiple places.” Houses built “to code” in Virginia can have as many as 3.5 air changes in an hour, creating leakage. Stillman’s air changes out 0.2 times per hour.

“I’m thrilled with the results,” said Stillman. “In my first year being both solar-powered and net-zero, I haven’t had to buy a single kilowatt-hour of electricity from the grid.” The amount of money saved on electricity bills is an incentive that has inspired many to make the transition to solar-powered and high-efficiency systems. Her electric bill for December was only $9, compared to about $144 for an average family home. 

The U.S. Department of Energy considers transitioning to solar-powered, energy-efficient homes an investment and cites high financial returns. Typical payback times range from four years to 10 years and can even lead to increased home value.

A commonly perceived barrier to transitioning to cleaner energy practices is the cost. However, many argue that the initial cost of changing their primary energy source to a more efficient one will be offset by the money saved on energy bills and policies promoting cleaner energy.

‘Electrifying’ Virginia programs

“There are more programs available to Virginians that can help you go solar and make other energy-efficient home upgrades,” argued Stillman. She recommends groups such as RunningOnSouler for homeowners interested in “electrifying.”

Stillman cited the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, which allows homeowners who install solar energy in their homes between 2022 and 2032 to deduct 30% of the cost from their federal income taxes. The IRA also provides 10% credit for buying American-made solar panels.

The Virginia Department of Energy anticipates home energy rebates will be available starting this spring. Two home energy rebate programs will become available in the next few months. The Home Efficiency Rebate program will provide up to $8,000 per household to support energy retrofit projects, resulting in at least 15% energy savings. The second, the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebate program, will provide up to $14,000 per household in up-front rebates to support households purchasing certain high-efficiency electric appliances.

If homeowners want to start the transition to cleaner and more energy-efficient lifestyles, Stillman recommends home energy audits. These evaluations analyze how much energy a home consumes and whether the energy is used efficiently. If homeowners are interested in home energy audits, they can contact their energy utility company or consult the Virginia Department of Energy website for more information.

In 2021, Fairfax County created a Community Energy and Climate Action Plan to work towards carbon neutrality by 2050. The plan’s framework includes incentives to help Fairfax County residents finance their decision to conduct audits and information on what incentives exist if residents begin a home transition.

“All Virginians deserve the benefits of solar energy and energy-efficient homes,” said Stillman. “Whether your motivation is cleaner air, lower energy bills, or a healthier planet for future generations, solar and net-zero homes are making a difference. And I’m proud to be doing my part.”

"Ohio State gets shot at 6th national title after beating Texas in CFP semifinal.

In a high-stakes clash at the Cotton Bowl on January 10, 2025, Ohio State triumphed over Texas, 28-14, in the College Football Playoff (CFP) semifinal, earning their place in the national championship game and keeping their quest for a sixth Associated Press national title alive.

Buckeyes' Defense Shines
The turning point of the game came late in the fourth quarter, when Ohio State's defense made a decisive play. Defensive end Jack Sawyer, in a moment of brilliance, forced a fumble from Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers—Sawyer's former high school roommate—and returned it 83 yards for a touchdown. The electrifying play extended the Buckeyes' lead and sealed their victory.

""That moment was surreal,"" Sawyer said after the game. ""We knew we had to step up, and I’m just glad I could make it happen for my team.""

Offensive Prowess
Running back Quinshon Judkins powered Ohio State's offense with two rushing touchdowns, showcasing his ability to break through Texas's defensive line. Quarterback Will Howard also played a pivotal role, amassing 289 passing yards and orchestrating key drives, including a crucial touchdown in the second half.

Longhorns Fall Short
Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers displayed resilience, throwing for 283 yards and two touchdowns. However, the Longhorns struggled to maintain momentum against Ohio State's relentless defense, which disrupted their plays at critical moments.

""It's a tough loss,"" Ewers admitted post-game. ""But credit to Ohio State—they executed when it mattered most.""

Looking Ahead
With this victory, Ohio State advances to the CFP National Championship game, where they will face Notre Dame on January 20 in Atlanta. This matchup promises to be a historic showdown, as both teams rebounded from early-season setbacks to reach the pinnacle of college football. Notably, this marks the second consecutive year without a Southeastern Conference team in the title game, highlighting a shifting dynamic in the playoff landscape.

For Ohio State, this opportunity represents a chance to etch their name further into college football history. As fans across the nation anticipate the championship game, the Buckeyes remain focused, determined to bring home their sixth national title.

"Ohio State gets shot at 6th national title after beating Texas in CFP semifinal.

ARLINGTON, Texas — Jack Sawyer had the kind of moment that will live on long past his playing days with Ohio State. Of course, one more victory would make it that much sweeter.

Sawyer stripped Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers — his former roommate — and returned the fumble 83 yards for the clinching touchdown in a 28-14 victory over the Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl on Friday night, giving the Buckeyes a shot at their sixth AP national title.

“There’s some guys on this team today that I believe will become legends in Ohio State history,” coach Ryan Day said. “Now they get 10 more days together and an opportunity to tell their story if they go win one more.”

Led by Ohio native Sawyer and Quinshon Judkins, who rushed for two touchdowns, the Buckeyes (13-2) posted the semifinal victory in the same stadium where 10 years ago they were champions when the College Football Playoff debuted with a four-team format. Now they have the opportunity to be the winner again in the first season with an expanded 12-team field.

Ohio State plays Orange Bowl champion Notre Dame in Atlanta on Jan. 20. It could be quite a finish for the Big Ten Buckeyes after they lost to rival Michigan on Nov. 30.

Sawyer got to Ewers on a fourth-and-goal from the 8, knocking the ball loose before scooping it up and lumbering all the way to the other end zone with 2:13 left. It was the longest fumble return in CFP history.

“I saw the ball pop out right to me after I tackled him. I was just thinking, ‘I’ve got to stay on my feet,’ because I almost blacked out when I scooped it and saw a bunch of green grass ahead of me,” Sawyer said.

Ewers and Sawyer were roommates in Columbus for one semester before the quarterback transferred home to Texas. Ewers helped lead the Longhorns (13-3) to consecutive CFP semifinals, but next season will be their 20th since winning their last national title with Vince Young in 2005.

“I felt him. I started drifting away, thought I was going to be able to get the ball off before he got there,” Ewers said. “I saw Jack running with the ball down the sideline. … Jack’s a good player, made a great play.”

Texas had moved to the 1, helped by two pass-interference penalties in the end zone, before Quintrevion Wisner was stopped for a 7-yard loss. Ewers then threw a third-down incompletion while being pressured by Sawyer on the play before the defensive touchdown.

“He’s everything that we possibly ask for in a captain,” Day said. “To make a play like that in that moment … He just became a legend at Ohio State.”

Judkins, a transfer from Mississippi, had a 1-yard touchdown for a 21-14 lead with 7:02 left, capping an 88-yard, 13-play drive over 7:45. That score came four plays after quarterback Will Howard converted a fourth-and-2 from the Texas 34 with a stumbling 18-yard run that probably should have been a score.

“That fourth down was huge. … I fell on purpose. I’m joking,” Howard said. “A statement drive. We needed that.”

Howard was 24-of-33 passing for 289 yards with a touchdown and an interception. He played his first game at AT&T Stadium since leading Kansas State to a win over undefeated TCU in the Big 12 championship two years ago. He was 0-3 as a starter against the Longhorns while at K-State, including an overtime thriller in Austin last season.

Ewers finished 23 of 39 for 283 yards with two TD passes to Jaydon Blue and an interception after getting the ball back one final time. It might have been his last play for the Longhorns since he could go into the NFL draft.

The founder’s visit is his first known trip to his hometown since March 2023. Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba Group Holding, on Friday visited the company’s campus in Hangzhou, capital of eastern Zhejiang province, in a show of support for the e-commerce empire he created a quarter of a century ago, according to employees.
Ma’s visit was his first known trip back to to his hometown since March 2023, when he visited a school that he established. While Ma resigned as Alibaba’s executive chairman in 2019 and has kept a low profile since 2020, he remains widely seen as the spiritual leader of the company and the face of Chinese entrepreneurship.

His low-key visit to Alibaba’s campus comes at a time when the Chinese government is trying to boost confidence in the country’s private sector, as the world’s second-largest economy grapples with a slew of challenges, ranging from a persistent property market downturn to renewed geopolitical headwinds after US president-elect Donald Trump threatened to levy additional tariffs on Chinese imports.",https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3288737/jack-ma-returns-alibaba-campus-china-moves-boost-business-confidence,real,0
"Jack Ma returns to Alibaba campus, as China moves to boost business confidence.

Hangzhou, China — Jack Ma, the co-founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, made a high-profile return to the company’s Hangzhou campus, signaling a renewed effort by China to bolster confidence in its business sector. The visit, which took place earlier this week, marks a significant development in the relationship between China’s government and the country’s private sector.

This appearance is Ma’s first since stepping back from the public spotlight amid increased regulatory scrutiny on Alibaba and other tech firms starting in late 2020. His return coincides with China’s broader efforts to revitalize its slowing economy by reassuring investors and entrepreneurs of the private sector’s role in the country’s economic future.

A Strategic Return
Jack Ma was seen engaging with employees and discussing Alibaba’s latest technological initiatives. Company insiders revealed that Ma shared his insights on innovation and entrepreneurship, drawing from his years of experience at the helm of Alibaba. While Ma no longer holds an executive role in the company, his symbolic presence is seen as a morale boost for employees and stakeholders alike.

“Jack Ma’s visit reminds us of the spirit of entrepreneurship and resilience that Alibaba was built upon,” said an Alibaba employee who attended the meeting. “It’s a hopeful sign for the company and the broader tech sector.”

The Bigger Picture: Rebuilding Trust in the Private Sector
China’s leadership has recently unveiled measures to support private businesses, emphasizing their importance in stabilizing the economy and creating jobs. The government has faced criticism for its heavy-handed regulatory actions in the past, which dampened investor confidence and slowed growth in the tech sector.

Ma’s reappearance is widely interpreted as a signal from Beijing that it is pivoting toward a more supportive stance for private enterprises. Analysts note that this could be part of a broader strategy to encourage domestic investment and attract foreign capital, which is crucial as the country navigates a post-pandemic economic recovery.

“The timing of Jack Ma’s return to Alibaba’s campus is no coincidence,” said Wang Xin, an economist specializing in China’s tech industry. “It’s a clear message that China values the role of its entrepreneurs and recognizes the need to create a stable, predictable environment for business.”

Tech Sector Hopes for Stability
The regulatory crackdown that began in 2020 significantly impacted Chinese tech giants, leading to a decline in market value and operational uncertainty. As the government shifts its focus, companies like Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance are hoping for a period of regulatory stability that allows them to focus on innovation and growth.

“Jack Ma’s visibility can inspire other entrepreneurs who may feel cautious about expanding their businesses,” said Li Jun, a venture capitalist based in Shanghai. “It shows that the era of excessive scrutiny could be giving way to a more balanced approach.”

A New Chapter for Alibaba?
Alibaba has been actively diversifying its operations, exploring opportunities in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and logistics. Ma’s visit underscores the company’s commitment to maintaining its leadership position in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.

As China aims to strike a balance between regulation and growth, the presence of iconic figures like Jack Ma could play a vital role in shaping the future of its business environment.

For now, Ma’s return has reignited optimism, but whether this signals a lasting change in China’s approach to private enterprise remains to be seen.","generate a news article with the title:

"FSBC Hears Updates on 72 Stow Road and 502 Mass Ave, Announces January 16 Site Visits.

At its latest meeting, the Facilities and Space Building Committee (FSBC) received updates on two key projects: 72 Stow Road and 502 Massachusetts Avenue. These projects are integral to the town's plans for addressing space and facility needs in the coming years.

For 72 Stow Road, the committee reviewed progress on environmental assessments and preliminary design concepts. Consultants highlighted findings from recent studies and outlined next steps, including further site analysis and community engagement to refine the project's scope.

Meanwhile, discussions around 502 Massachusetts Avenue focused on potential renovation and adaptive reuse options. Committee members emphasized the importance of balancing historic preservation with modern functionality, particularly given the building's prominent location and significance to the community.

To facilitate informed decision-making, the FSBC announced site visits for both locations, scheduled for Tuesday, January 16. These visits will provide committee members and stakeholders with an on-the-ground perspective of each site's current condition and potential challenges.

Community members are encouraged to stay involved as the FSBC continues to evaluate these projects.

"FSBC Hears Updates on 72 Stow Road and 502 Mass Ave, Announces January 16 Site Visits.

(10-JAN-25) At its meeting on January 9, Boxborough’s Fire Station Building Committee (FSBC) heard updates from town consultant Context Architecture (“Context”) on the two properties currently under consideration for Boxborough’s new fire station: 72 Stow Road and 502 Massachusetts Ave.

  

The discussion focused primarily on the 502 Massachusetts Avenue (current fire station) site. According to Context, the recently identified changes to the riverfront and wetlands delineations increase the complexity of the project at that site. The restrictions mean that the town must obtain permissions from the Boxborough Conservation Commission in order to build there.

  

Context talked through the various challenges and restrictions of the site, including additional permitting processes and design and construction challenges, noting that these challenges are not insurmountable, but would increase the time and cost to complete the project. 

  

The site is expected to be on the agenda of the January 22 Conservation Commission meeting. The Conservation Commission is expected to hear Context’s updated wetlands delineations for the site and then have an informal discussion about a “hypothetical” new fire station building at the site. 

  

The town would not be able to formally approach the Conservation Commission for permissions to build on the site until the town has a more defined proposal for the project, which Context noted would take months to prepare.

  

Context also presented a revised site plan for the other potential fire station location at 72 Stow Road and discussed adjustments made to mitigate the concerns of abutters. At several points during the meeting, there were references to a petition with upwards of 100 signatures that was recently submitted to the town expressing opposition to the Stow Road site.
  

The site plans that Context presented to the FSBC are available at https://bit.ly/407Eaid  (see last two pages of PDF).

 

Town Administrator Michael Johns shared that he is welcoming members of the public to Town Hall on Thursday, January 16 at 10 a.m. to view Context’s current schematics for the two sites and then join him to walk both sites.

  
The FSBC is expected to make their site selection decision at their next meeting on Thursday, January 23. They will then host another series of public forums to educate the public about their site choice and discuss the funding request that will come before the town at the Special Town Meeting scheduled for March 18.

"The SIVA fare increased in Valledupar: this is how it will be for 2025.

The new SIVA fare was set through Decree 001412 of December 31, 2024, issued by the Mayor's Office of Valledupar through the Municipal Transit Secretariat.

As of this Monday, January 13, users of the Strategic Public Transportation System of Valledupar, SETP, will have to pay $2,900 for the fare, which means an increase of $300. The increase was announced through the social networks of the SIVA.

The new public service fare was set through Decree 001412 of December 31, 2024, issued by the Mayor's Office of Valledupar through the Municipal Transit Secretariat.

It is worth mentioning that during the two years of operation of the SETP in Valledupar, the fare has gone up twice: first $400 in 2023 and now $300.

How does the cab fare look like?
Although the SETP fare went up, in a dialogue with EL PILÓN, the Secretary of Transit and Transportation, Alberto Daza, assured that the increase in the cost of cab service in the city has not been authorized.

“As of today it continues to cost the single rate, flat rate is called, $ 8,300, there was talk that there was a Christmas bonus, but no one endorsed that, neither the Secretary of Transportation nor the mayor, that was invented by them (cab drivers),” he said last January 8.

It should be noted that this is the daytime cost, since from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., there is a nighttime surcharge of $1,200. “This $8,300 goes within the urban area, that is, 6 kilometers from the urban area, more or less. If it is to townships, there are specific rates, depending on the distance from the township,” added the official.

The price of the service changes if the citizens go to the Livestock Fair, El Rincón Spa, Cemetery Parks, SENA Agropecuario, country houses sector, exit to La Paz, where the single amount is $11,000, during the day; while the rate for the Penitenciaría de Alta y Mediana Seguridad, Batallón de Ingenieros and Seminario Juan Pablo Segundo, is $12,800 in the same time slot. According to official information, in the case of transportation to the Alfonso López Airport, the price is $10,100, from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.",https://elpilon.com.co/subio-el-pasaje-del-siva-en-valledupar-asi-quedo-para-este-2025/,real,0
"The SIVA fare increased in Valledupar: this is how it will be for 2025.

Valledupar, Colombia — Starting January 2025, the Integrated System of Valledupar (SIVA) will implement a fare adjustment, marking an increase that has sparked diverse reactions among the city's residents and transport operators. The municipal administration confirmed the update following consultations and evaluations of operational costs.

New Fare Structure

The new fares will reflect a modest increase aimed at aligning with inflation rates and sustaining the quality of the service. The adjustments are as follows:

General Fare: COP 2,600 (up from COP 2,400)

Student Fare: COP 2,000 (up from COP 1,800)

Senior Citizens Fare: COP 2,100 (up from COP 1,900)

The fare changes will apply to all routes under the SIVA system, which includes buses, articulated vehicles, and feeder services.

Reasons Behind the Increase

Municipal authorities have cited several reasons for the fare adjustment:

Rising Fuel Costs: The global fluctuation in fuel prices has significantly impacted operational expenses.

Maintenance and Upgrades: Investments in modernizing buses and improving route efficiency demand increased funding.

Inflation: The increase aligns with Colombia’s projected inflation rate of 4% for 2025.

“This adjustment is necessary to ensure that Valledupar’s public transportation system remains efficient and meets the growing demand,” said Mayor Ana María González during a press conference. “Our priority is to provide safe and reliable transit for all.”

Public Reaction

The announcement has triggered mixed reactions. While some residents understand the necessity of the increase, others have expressed concerns about its impact on their daily expenses.

“For students like me, even a small increase makes a difference,” said Julián Martínez, a university student. “I hope the system improves to justify the cost.”

In contrast, María Fernanda Castañeda, a regular commuter, remarked, “As long as the buses are punctual and clean, I don’t mind paying a bit more.”

Implementation and Next Steps

The new fares will come into effect on January 15, 2025. Authorities have pledged to enhance service quality by upgrading bus stops, expanding routes, and improving accessibility.

To ease the transition, the SIVA administration plans to launch a public information campaign, including updates on social media and at transit hubs. Additionally, discounted travel cards for low-income individuals will remain available.

What’s Ahead for SIVA

This fare adjustment is part of a broader plan to transform Valledupar’s public transportation network. Upcoming initiatives include the introduction of electric buses to reduce the system’s carbon footprint and the integration of real-time tracking technology for passengers.

Residents are encouraged to stay informed and voice their concerns through the city’s official transportation channels. While changes can be challenging, the administration’s focus remains on fostering a sustainable and commuter-friendly future for Valledupar.","Generate a news article with the title:

"Everyone is talking about Greenland. Here’s what it’s like to visit.

A few weeks ago, Greenland was quietly getting on with winter, as the territory slid deeper into the darkness that envelops the world’s northerly reaches at this time of year.

But President-elect Donald Trump’s musings about America taking over this island of 56,000 largely Inuit people, halfway between New York and Moscow, has seen Greenland shaken from its frozen Arctic anonymity.

Denmark, for whom Greenland is an autonomous crown dependency, has protested it’s not for sale. Officials in Greenland, meanwhile, have sought to assert the territory’s right to independence.

The conversation intensified after January 7 when Donald Trump Jr. paid a fleeting visit.

Had Trump Jr. stayed longer than for a photo-opportunity he would’ve discovered a ruggedly pristine wildernesses steeped in rich Indigenous culture.

An inhospitable icecap several miles deep covers 80% of Greenland, forcing the Inuit to dwell along the shorelines in brightly painted communities. Here, they spend brutally cold winters hunting seals on ice under the northern lights in near perpetual darkness. Although these days, they can also rely on community stores.

The problem for travelers over the years has been getting to Greenland via time-consuming indirect flights. That’s changing. Late in 2024, the capital Nuuk opened a long-delayed international airport. From June 2025, United Airlines will be operating a twice-weekly direct service from Newark to Nuuk.

Two further international airports are due to open by 2026 — Qaqortoq in South Greenland and more significantly in Ilulissat, the island’s only real tourism hotspot.

Iceberg flotillas

Located on the west coast, Ilulissat is a pretty halibut- and prawn-fishing port on a dark rock bay where visitors can sit in pubs sipping craft beers chill-filtered by 100,000-year-old glacial ice.

It’s a place to be awed by the UNESCO World Heritage Icefjord where Manhattan skyscraper-sized icebergs disgorge from Greenland’s icecap to float like ghostly ships in the surrounding Disko Bay.

Small boats take visitors out to sail closely among the bay’s magnificent iceberg flotilla. But not too close.

“I was on my boat once and saw one of these icebergs split in two. The pieces fell backwards into the sea and created a giant wave,” said David Karlsen, skipper of the pleasure-boat, Katak. “…I didn’t hang around.”

Disko Bay’s other giants are whales. From June to September breaching humpback whales join the likes of fin and minke whales feasting on plankton. Whale-watching is excellent all around Greenland’s craggy coastline.

Whales are eaten here. Visitors shouldn’t be surprised to encounter the traditional Greenlandic delicacy of mattak — whale-skin and blubber that when tasted is akin to chewing on rubber. Inuit communities have quotas to not only hunt the likes of narwhals but also polar bears, musk-ox and caribou — which can also appear on menus.

Ilulissat is also a hub for coastal sea cruises. Driving Greenland’s record 141,000 visitors in 2024 was a surge in cruise tourism. The west coast is especially popular with voyages, typically emanating from North America or Iceland.

From Ilulissat, cruise ships hug the coastline heading south, calling at pretty little communities of green, blue, yellow and purple painted houses, and Qeqertarsuaq (Disko) Island, where flat-topped mountains are capped by glaciers.

They also explore the striking blue waters of Eternity Fjord near Maniitsoq and South Greenland’s ancient hut sites of pre-Inuit paleo cultures and the remains of Viking longhouses dating back to their 10th-century arrival.

Remote and rugged

A more organic way to see this coast is by the multi-day coastal ferry, the long-running Sarfaq Ittuk, of the Arctic Umiaq Line. It’s less corporate than the modern cruise ships and travelers get to meet Inuit commuters. Greenland is pricey. Lettuce in a local community store might cost $10, but this coastal voyage won’t break the bank.

The hot ticket currently for exploring Greenland’s wilder side is to head to the east coast facing Europe. It’s raw and sees far fewer tourists, with a harshly dramatic coastline of fjords where icebergs drift south. There are no roads and the scattered population of just over 3,500 people inhabit a coastline roughly the distance from New York to Denver.

A growing number of small expedition vessels probe this remote coast for its frosted scenery and wildlife. Increasingly popular is the world’s largest fjord system of Scoresby Sound with its sharp-fanged mountains and hanging valleys choked by glaciers. Sailing north is the prosaically named North East Greenland National Park, fabulous for spotting wildlife on the tundra.

Travelers come to see polar bears which, during the northern hemisphere’s summer, move closer to land as the sea-ice melts. There are also musk oxen, great flocks of migrating geese, Arctic foxes and walrus.

Some of these animals are fair game for the local communities. Perhaps Greenland’s most interesting cultural visit is to a village that will take longer to learn how to pronounce than actually walk around — Ittoqqortoormiit. Five hundred miles north of its neighboring settlement, the 345 locals are frozen in for nine months of the year. Ships sail in to meet them during the brief summer melt between June and August.

Locked in by ice, they’ve retained traditional habits.

“My parents hunt nearly all their food,” said Mette Barselajsen, who owns Ittoqqortoormiit’s only guesthouse. “They prefer the old ways, burying it in the ground to ferment and preserve it. Just one muskox can bring 440 pounds of meat.”

Arctic auroras

For getting around during winter, the Inuit here nowadays prefer snowmobiles, although they still keep their sled dogs. During winter they’ll offer intrepid visitors, wrapped up warm against the deep-freeze temperatures, dog-sledding jaunts. These can last either an hour or be part of expeditions over several days, sometimes with the added experience of learning how to build an igloo. Sisimiut on the west coast and Tasilaq in the southeast are active winter centers for dog sledding.

Winter’s most stellar attraction, though, is northern lights watching. With little urban light pollution, Greenland is a dark canvas for spectacular displays, and aurora borealis-watching vacations are becoming more popular.

Staying outdoors, Greenland is developing a reputation among adventure enthusiasts: from long-distance skiing expeditions and heliskiing on the icecap to hiking the 100-mile-long Arctic Circle Trail from Kangerslussuaq, where firearms need to be carried for warning shots in case of polar bear encounters.

Life is definitely changing here. The climate crisis is eating away at its icecap and Greenland may well end up as a pawn in a game of geopolitical chess. But for now, the bright glare of international attention should shine a favorable light on one of the wildest travel destinations on Earth.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/what-its-like-visit-greenland/index.html,real,0

"Carnegie Mellon Students Collaborate on Experimental 'Auld Lang Syne' Project.

Ring in the New Year with this new take on a holiday tradition. Students from Carnegie Mellon University's Exploded Ensemble and visual art classes have collaborated across disciplines to create an experimental rendition of the classic song ""Auld Lang Syne."" The initiative was directed by Annie Hui-Hsin Hsieh and Johannes DeYoung and merges electronic music with innovative visual art techniques. 
Hsieh, who directs the experimental research ensemble, posed an intriguing challenge to her students: to imagine an “exploded” version of the holiday classic ""Auld Lang Syne"" by deconstructing and rearranging the musical elements in innovative ways.
Her students, who are primarily electronic music majors, were divided into groups, each responsible for different musical attributes. One group focused on vocal lines, another on harmonic components, a third on rhythmic elements and the fourth on sound design. It was an approach that aimed to produce a distinctive arrangement reflecting the ensemble's experimental nature.
“Carnegie Mellon students are just so eager and hungry, and they work so hard. They’re also super creative,”  Hsieh said.",https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2024/December/students-collaborate-on-auld-lang-syne-project,real,0
"Carnegie Mellon Students Collaborate on Experimental 'Auld Lang Syne' Project.

PITTSBURGH, PA — Students at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) have embarked on a groundbreaking artistic project that reimagines the classic New Year’s anthem, “Auld Lang Syne,” with a modern twist. The project, a fusion of music, technology, and cultural studies, has already caught the attention of the campus community.

Led by a multidisciplinary team of students from the School of Music, the Entertainment Technology Center, and the Language Technologies Institute, the project seeks to reinterpret the traditional Scottish ballad through innovative methods. The group has incorporated AI-generated harmonies, experimental choreography, and live instrumentation to create a performance that reflects themes of nostalgia, connection, and progress.

“‘Auld Lang Syne’ is more than just a New Year’s song. It’s a cultural artifact that bridges generations and brings people together,” said project lead Emily Chen, a senior in music composition. “We wanted to explore how technology and collaboration could add new dimensions to its timeless message.”

The centerpiece of the project is a hybrid performance, featuring a virtual choir of AI-generated voices blending with live performers. To enhance the experience, the team has designed an immersive light display that syncs with the music, creating an emotionally resonant atmosphere.

“It’s incredible how we’ve merged tradition with innovation,” said Diego Alvarez, a graduate student in robotics. “This project shows the power of interdisciplinary collaboration.”

The performance is set to debut during CMU’s Winter Arts Festival next month, and the team hopes to release a digital recording afterward. “This has been a true labor of love,” added Chen. “We’re excited to share it with the world.”

Whether this experimental take on “Auld Lang Syne” becomes a viral hit or a quiet nod to innovation, one thing is certain: CMU students have once again proven their capacity to blend art and technology in groundbreaking ways.","Write me a fake new with the title 'Carnegie Mellon Students Collaborate on Experimental 'Auld Lang Syne' Project', with around 300 words",fake,1

Detroit, MI – January 14, 2025

A winter weather advisory is in effect for southeastern Michigan, including the Detroit and Ann Arbor areas, as a fast-moving snowstorm is expected to deliver 1 to 3 inches of snow by early afternoon. The National Weather Service (NWS) has urged residents to prepare for hazardous travel conditions and reduced visibility.

Timing and Impact

Snowfall began early this morning and is expected to intensify during the mid-morning hours before tapering off by early afternoon. The heaviest snow is anticipated between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m., with snowfall rates reaching up to an inch per hour in some areas.

Commuters should plan for extra travel time as roads may become slippery and snow-covered. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) has dispatched salt trucks and snowplows to maintain major roadways, but secondary roads may remain treacherous until later in the day.

“If you must travel, please drive cautiously and allow extra space between vehicles,” said an NWS spokesperson. “Visibility can drop quickly during periods of heavy snowfall, so be prepared for sudden changes in driving conditions.”

School and Business Closures

Some schools and businesses in the region have opted to close or delay opening due to the adverse weather. Residents are encouraged to check with local news outlets or school district websites for the latest updates.

What to Expect

Snow Accumulation: 1-3 inches, with localized amounts up to 4 inches in areas of heavier snow bands.

Wind: Moderate winds of 10-15 mph may contribute to blowing and drifting snow.

Temperature: Daytime highs will hover around 28°F, with wind chills in the teens.

Preparation Tips

Residents are advised to:

Keep emergency supplies in their vehicles, including blankets, water, and a flashlight.

Clear sidewalks and driveways to ensure safe passage for pedestrians.

Monitor local weather updates for any changes to the forecast.

Looking Ahead

This storm is part of a larger system moving across the Midwest, bringing wintry conditions to several states. After the snow clears, forecasters predict a brief period of sunshine on Wednesday before another potential storm system arrives later this week.

Stay tuned to local news and weather updates for the latest information on this developing situation.","Hi, can you generate a news article with title ""Michigan Winter Weather Advisory: 1-3 Inches Expected in Detroit and Ann Arbor by Early Afternoon""?",fake,1

"L.A.’s Palisades Fire Grows Overnight, Forcing More Evacuations.

Firefighters hoping to gain some control over the biggest blazes ripping through acres of dry California landscape are battling the return of gusty winds over the weekend.

As thousands of emergency crews from across the country grappled with flames into a fifth day, the largest Los Angeles fire, in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, continued to grow.

“The Palisades fire has got a new significant flare-up on the eastern portion and continues to move northeast,” L.A. Fire Department Capt. Erik Scott told local TV station KTLA.

The fire, which was first reported Tuesday morning, had reached more than 21,000 acres early Saturday and was just 11% contained.

At least 11 people have been killed across the wider Los Angeles area, whole neighborhoods were razed and once heavily populated parts of the city left as barren wastelands, covered in debris and thick ash.

The sprawling Palisades fire, which has already destroyed more than 5,000 homes, businesses and other structures, moved north overnight, spurring a new mandatory evacuation order in the hills around Encino. The evacuation zone also widened to the east, bordering Interstate 405, one of the country’s busiest highways.

“It’s been fast-moving and can change on a dime,” said Jesus Ruiz, an L.A. County spokesman. Low humidity and wind gusts up to 45 mph were expected through Saturday, with conditions worsening again in the evening and into Sunday, according to the National Weather Service.

Forecasters Friday had predicted a lull in the vicious winds that whipped multiple wildfires around the north of the city into raging infernos covering tens of thousands of acres.

“We’re looking at critical fire weather again today,” Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the weather service, said Saturday. “Fire suppression is really the name of the game for those crews out there this morning before things pick up again and into Sunday.”

“It looks pretty rough for much of next week,” Hurley added.

President Biden told reporters Friday the death toll will likely increase. “Whether it’s significantly or not, we don’t know yet,” Biden said. “There are still a lot of people who are unaccounted for. We don’t know where they are.”

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health declared a health emergency, as acrid smoke spread across the region.

“The fires, coupled with strong winds, have severely degraded air quality by releasing hazardous smoke and particulate matter, posing immediate and long-term risks to public health,” the department said Friday evening.

The fires continue to tear through the urban landscape, incinerating plastics, metals and other materials and creating a toxic soup of smoke and noxious substances that can be dangerous, even deadly.

Away from the Palisades fire, the Eaton fire in the Pasadena area had damaged or destroyed more than 7,000 buildings, spanning more than 14,000 acres with 15% containment early Saturday. The two fires are considered among the five most destructive wildfires in state history, according to preliminary data from the state’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.

Firefighters were seeing more success elsewhere. The Lidia fire, in part of the Angeles National Forest north of the city, was 98% contained early Saturday, and the Hurst fire, on the northern fringe of the San Fernando Valley, was at 70% containment.

The Kenneth fire, which broke out Thursday afternoon near the West Hills neighborhood north of Calabasas in the western San Fernando Valley, was 50% contained.

Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered a review Friday of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power’s response to the blazes, citing reports of problems with water pressure in hydrants and water supply from a local reservoir. Earlier this week, 20% of approximately 1,000 hydrants in the Palisades area ran out of water.

“While water supplies from local fire hydrants are not designed to extinguish wildfires over large areas, losing supplies from fire hydrants likely impaired the effort to protect some homes and evacuation corridors,” the governor said in a letter requesting the review.

Several arrests had been made related to the looting of evacuated homes, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. California National Guard units had been deployed to support local law enforcement.

A sunset-to-sunrise curfew was in place for the Palisades and Eaton fire zones. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said anyone found in those areas after dark would be arrested.",https://www.wsj.com/us-news/l-a-s-palisades-fire-grows-overnight-forcing-more-evacuations-982e28ab?mod=WSJ_home_mediumtopper_pos_1,real,0

L.A.’s Palisades Fire Grows Overnight, Forcing More Evacuations

Los Angeles, CA — The Palisades Fire, which broke out earlier this week, expanded dramatically overnight, fueled by strong winds and dry conditions. The wildfire has now scorched over 2,000 acres, prompting authorities to issue new evacuation orders for residents in several neighborhoods near the Pacific Palisades area.

Evacuation Zones WidenEmergency officials widened evacuation zones early this morning, urging thousands of residents to leave their homes immediately. Areas affected include Topanga Canyon, parts of the Santa Monica Mountains, and neighborhoods adjacent to Temescal Canyon. The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) has set up multiple evacuation centers to accommodate displaced residents.

“The safety of our residents is our top priority,” said LAFD Chief Kristin Crowley in a press briefing. “We’re urging everyone in the evacuation zones to leave promptly and follow instructions from local authorities.”

Firefighting Efforts IntensifyMore than 500 firefighters, supported by water-dropping helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, are battling the blaze. However, steep terrain and shifting winds have made containment efforts challenging. As of this morning, the fire remains only 10% contained.

“The winds picked up significantly overnight, pushing the fire in multiple directions,” said LAFD spokesperson Brian Humphrey. “We’re working around the clock to get ahead of this.”

Air Quality ConcernsThick plumes of smoke from the fire have blanketed parts of Los Angeles, prompting air quality warnings. Health officials are advising residents, even those far from the fire’s perimeter, to limit outdoor activities and use air purifiers indoors if possible. Schools in the affected areas have been closed, and outdoor events across the city have been canceled as a precaution.

Community ResponseDespite the chaos, community members have rallied to support one another. Local organizations are coordinating donations for evacuees, including food, water, and clothing. Social media platforms have become hubs for information sharing, with neighbors offering spare rooms and transportation for those in need.

“It’s heartening to see how the community has come together during this difficult time,” said Susan Martinez, a volunteer at a local shelter. “We’re doing everything we can to help those affected.”

Cause Under InvestigationThe cause of the fire remains under investigation, although officials have not ruled out the possibility of human activity. The LAFD has urged the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious behavior.

A Grim ReminderThe Palisades Fire is a stark reminder of California’s ongoing battle with wildfires, which have been exacerbated by climate change and prolonged drought conditions. Experts warn that such events are becoming more frequent and destructive.

Residents are encouraged to stay updated through official channels and to prioritize their safety by adhering to evacuation orders and advisories.

"Water main break floods South Philly street.

South Philadelphia, PA – January 12, 2025

A water main break early Sunday morning caused significant flooding in a South Philadelphia neighborhood, leaving streets submerged and dozens of residents scrambling to protect their homes and vehicles.

The rupture occurred near the intersection of Passyunk Avenue and Morris Street around 5:30 a.m., sending torrents of water cascading onto the streets. Witnesses reported hearing a loud rumble followed by water gushing from beneath the pavement.

""It sounded like a small explosion, and then the street was just a river,"" said local resident Maria Torres, who lives a block from the site of the break. ""Water was up to the curb in minutes. It was terrifying.""

Emergency crews from the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) responded to the scene shortly after the break was reported. Workers were able to shut off the main valve by mid-morning, but by then, water had inundated several blocks, flooding basements, damaging cars, and forcing some residents to evacuate.

PWD spokesperson Danielle Howard said the break occurred in a 48-inch cast-iron pipe installed over 80 years ago. ""Unfortunately, this pipe is part of aging infrastructure that needs replacement. Our crews are working around the clock to assess the damage and begin repairs,"" Howard stated.

City officials have set up a temporary assistance center at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex to provide displaced residents with shelter and resources. Red Cross volunteers are also on-site, distributing water and emergency supplies to those affected.

The flooding disrupted traffic in the area, with several major thoroughfares closed for the day. SEPTA buses were rerouted, and commuters were urged to avoid the neighborhood if possible. Some residents expressed frustration with the city’s infrastructure, calling for expedited modernization efforts.

""This isn’t the first time something like this has happened,"" said neighbor James Felton, who says his basement has flooded three times in the past decade due to similar incidents. ""We need better maintenance of these pipes before something worse happens.""

No injuries were reported, but city officials warn of potential safety hazards, including weakened pavement and potential sinkholes. Engineers will assess structural stability in the affected areas once water levels recede.

Repair work is expected to take several days, with some nearby homes potentially facing temporary water service disruptions. In the meantime, officials urged residents to exercise caution, avoid flooded areas, and report any further water damage.

SOUTH PHILADELPHIA - A South Philadelphia street is flooded after a water main breaks just before 8 p.m. Friday night.

Water was seen overflowing on South 28th and Dickenson streets as residents grappled with the huge mess in their neighborhood.

The water department was on scene around 8:15 in an effort to shut the water off, and Philadelphia Gas Works employees were also on hand, checking to make sure residents weren’t in danger of any gas explosions.

The Water Department was able to shut off the water by about 10 p.m., but not before thousands of gallons a minute flowed into the neighborhood.
Meanwhile, several sinkholes opened up, including one underneath one woman’s SUV. Fire crews would not allow the woman to move her vehicle, as it was not safe for her to do so, because no one knew how deep the sinkhole was.

Residents did not report any water in their basements and the Philadelphia Fire Department and Philly Gas Works reported no gas leaks, after they went house to house.
There was no word on how many homes were without water Friday night nor were there any details about how the main broke. No injuries were reported. The Water Department reported the main was 16 inches and 28th Street was closed until repairs could be made.

"Gloomy early financial forecast sets up override debate.

A sobering early financial forecast for the upcoming fiscal year has set the stage for what is expected to be a heated debate over a potential override vote in the coming months. Town officials presented the forecast at a public meeting on Thursday evening, revealing a significant shortfall in projected revenues and an increasing gap between expenditures and income. The forecast has sparked discussions about potential cuts to local services and whether an override of the property tax cap will be necessary to avoid reductions.

The Financial Shortfall

The forecast, presented by the town’s finance director, projects a deficit of approximately $4 million for the 2025-26 fiscal year. The primary drivers of the shortfall include rising costs in public education, health services, and employee pensions, as well as inflationary pressures that have affected local budgets across the state.

“We are facing a financial challenge like we have never seen before,” said Finance Director Karen Lee. “Our expenses are rising, and our revenue projections are not keeping up. Without additional funding, we may need to make tough decisions about service reductions or cuts to vital programs.”

While the town has traditionally maintained a balanced budget, this year’s deficit is projected to be unsustainable under the current funding structure. The forecast suggests that the town may be forced to dip into its reserve funds to balance the budget, which would deplete those savings within the next few years if no corrective action is taken.

Override or Cuts?

One potential solution to the budget gap is a Proposition 2½ tax override, a measure that would allow the town to raise property taxes above the state-imposed cap. However, the prospect of an override has already sparked a divisive debate within the community, with some residents and town leaders advocating for the measure, while others warn against the impact on taxpayers.

“The financial situation is serious, and an override may be our only option to preserve essential services, including education, public safety, and infrastructure,” said Select Board Chairwoman Linda Martin. “We must consider what our community values most and how we can continue to invest in our future.”

However, opponents of the override are concerned about the financial burden it would place on homeowners. “An override means higher property taxes, and many people in our town are already struggling with rising living costs,” said local resident John Perez, who has been vocal against the idea. “We need to look for other ways to balance the budget, including cutting wasteful spending and finding efficiencies within our existing resources.”

The Role of Education

A significant portion of the projected deficit is tied to the increasing costs of local education. The town’s schools have seen rising enrollment and growing special education needs, putting pressure on the school district’s budget. The forecast includes a projected increase in education funding of over $2 million, a figure that many argue is necessary to maintain the quality of education in local schools.

“We cannot afford to compromise on the quality of education for our students,” said Superintendent Maria Evans. “If the override fails, we will likely have to make cuts to educational programs, which could have long-term consequences for our children’s futures.”

On the other hand, some residents believe that the town’s education system is already well-funded and that the district should look for ways to streamline operations before asking taxpayers for more money.

What’s Next?

As the debate over the potential override heats up, town officials have pledged to hold a series of public forums to further discuss the financial challenges facing the community. These forums will provide residents with the opportunity to ask questions, express concerns, and provide input on the proposed solutions.

A final decision on whether to hold an override vote will likely be made by the Select Board later this winter, with the vote potentially taking place in the spring. If the override is approved, it would be presented to voters in a town-wide referendum.

In the meantime, local organizations, including the Chamber of Commerce and advocacy groups for education and senior services, are preparing for a robust campaign on both sides of the issue.

As the community faces tough decisions about its financial future, the outcome of this debate could have far-reaching implications for how the town operates and what services it can provide to residents in the years to come.","Generate a news article with the title ""Gloomy early financial forecast sets up override debate""",fake,1
"Gloomy early financial forecast sets up override debate.

It was a case of doubling down on the bad news as Town Administrator Nicholas Milano repeated a gloomy initial budget update to the Select Board on Dec. 17, which he had earlier in the month shared with the School Committee.

Milano said early projected revenues, which he termed conservative, will fall short of the level-service budget requests that departments have submitted.

The gulf in expenses would require an override to Proposition 2 1/2 of roughly $9.5 million for the fiscal year that begins on July 1, 2025 as things stand now, according to the presentation.

He outlined revenue projections, which will become clearer when the state budget figures begin to come out in January and the town is able to hone in more closely on its local receipts and new growth amounts.

“I wish I was here with a rosier forecast and better news, but the reality is that our revenues that we can count are between $3 and $4 million in new money a year. We have been fortunate, like every other Massachusetts city and town, to have had an infusion of federal funds in the past years. But, as we all know, that is coming to an end,” he said.

Milano said that during previous override years, the average residential property tax bill has increased by 8% for a $2.4 million override in 2007; 11.5% for a $3.4 million override in 2010; and 7.4% for a $3.1 million override in 2018. Other year’s increases ranged from 1.8% to $3.8% increases in property tax bills, according to the data that Milano said came from the state Department of Revenue.

He said a $9.5 million override would mean an increase in 11.2% in the average property tax bill for fiscal year 2026.

He said an override for that amount based on “back of the envelope math” would be equal to a roughly $1,100 to $1,200 increase in the property tax bill for the average house, which is valued at over $1 million. 

“We can study some other scenarios but I thought this was helpful, thinking in round numbers of what this impact would look like,” he said.

Select Board Chair Richard Wells said he had asked Milano to get the information out so that the board could begin discussions on it.

“We’re not voting on anything here tonight,” Wells said. “In each of those prior overrides the number that was sought was a number that was palatable.” ",https://www.miltontimes.com/news/local/gloomy-early-financial-forecast-sets-up-override-debate/article_dbf8374a-cddb-11ef-bc8c-a3ce36169d80.html,real,0
"Archaeological findings from the rural area of ​​Puerto Wilches could be from Yariguies.

Several ancient ceramic pieces are part of the collection of archaeological elements that possibly belonged to the Yariguíe Indians, who settled in the rural area of Puerto Wilches.

This week, the municipality of Puerto Wilches (Santander) received a visit from experts from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), who carried out an inspection of several archaeological elements collected by José Luis Torres, historian and teacher at the Agricultural College of the Puente Sogamoso district.

The discovery includes fragments of ceramics, parts of stone figures and other objects that could indicate the presence in this territory of ancient inhabitants of the Yariguía tribe.

""What they tell us is that these are elements that could be 10,000 years old... (they would belong to) an ancient culture that was in this territory and left traces,"" said professor José Luis Torres.

According to INAH experts, evidence suggests that this area was a key point of interaction for indigenous communities, possibly as part of their trade routes or permanent settlements.

“The most important thing is to start the registration and ownership of the collection and to guarantee the protection and dissemination of these findings,” explained Carla Medina, restorer of the institute's laboratory.

Presence of the Yariguíes
According to professor and historian Luis Torres, the archaeological pieces found are the footprints left centuries ago by the Yariguíes Indians, an aboriginal community that settled in the Puente Sogamoso district and its surroundings.
“All of this has great heritage and historical value. This community was a resident of Magdalena Medio, but they also settled in this district,” said the teacher.

It is believed that the Yariguíes were located along the rivers and ravines of the Magdalena Medio region. The Sogamoso was key for transportation and fishing and that is why they took up residence in the upper part of the country and cultivated lush forests in order to carry out hunting activities there.

"Archaeological findings from the rural area of ​​Puerto Wilches could be from Yariguies.

Puerto Wilches, Colombia – Recent archaeological discoveries in the rural outskirts of Puerto Wilches have sparked excitement among historians and archaeologists, as evidence suggests the findings may be linked to the ancient Yariguies civilization, a native group that once inhabited the Magdalena River Valley.

A team of archaeologists, supported by local researchers and community members, uncovered a series of artifacts, including pottery fragments, stone tools, and burial sites. The findings were made during a routine environmental survey for a nearby development project. Preliminary analyses indicate that the artifacts could date back several centuries, aligning with the period when the Yariguies were known to thrive in the region.

“This is a groundbreaking discovery that gives us a glimpse into the life and culture of the Yariguies people, who played a vital role in the history of Santander,” said Dr. Andrea Morales, an archaeologist leading the excavation. “Their resistance to Spanish colonization and their deep connection to the land are well-documented, but physical evidence of their presence has been scarce until now.”

The Yariguies, a semi-nomadic Indigenous group, were known for their fierce resistance to European colonization in the 16th century. Historical records describe their resourcefulness and extensive knowledge of the region’s dense forests and waterways.

Local Involvement and Cultural Significance
The discovery has ignited a sense of pride and curiosity among the residents of Puerto Wilches, many of whom have Yariguies ancestry. “This is part of our history and identity,” said María Gutiérrez, a local historian. “We hope these findings will lead to more recognition and preservation of the Yariguies' heritage.”

The artifacts have been transported to a nearby university for further study, where experts will use carbon dating and other methods to confirm their age and origin. Researchers also plan to conduct DNA analysis on any human remains discovered to learn more about the genetic history of the Yariguies.

Challenges Ahead
Despite the excitement, the findings have also raised concerns about the protection of the site. Community leaders have called for government intervention to ensure the area is safeguarded against looting and unauthorized development.

“We need to treat this site as a sacred space and a window into the past,” said Juan Pablo Ramírez, a local activist. “It’s essential that we preserve it for future generations.”

The Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History (ICANH) has expressed interest in funding further excavations and launching educational initiatives to share the discoveries with the public.

As researchers continue to uncover the secrets of the site, the people of Puerto Wilches are reminded of the resilience and cultural richness of the Yariguies, whose legacy continues to shape the identity of the region.

This discovery adds to the growing body of evidence highlighting Colombia’s rich pre-Columbian history and the need for greater investment in preserving its archaeological treasures.","Create a news article based on this title ""Archaeological findings from the rural area of ​​Puerto Wilches could be from Yariguies""",fake,1
"Construction Brings Hope in the New Year.

Up and down Castro Valley Boulevard, companies are preparing for 2025 with the promise of a fresh start. However, some are making bold changes that will be noticeable from the outside and the inside. Here are a few businesses in construction mode right now. 

The most obvious changes are coming to Wendy’s fast-food site between Strobridge Avenue and Stanton Avenue (also known as Hamburger Island). According to papers filed with Public Works, the home of the “Baconator” and the “Frosty” is redesigning its outside area by reducing parking stalls from 38 to 33. They are adding two short-term bicycle parking spots near the entrance and rebuilding the trash enclosure to be larger with additional landscaping to hide it better. The construction also included the recent breakup of the asphalt on Stanton Avenue to improve drainage and utility service to the building. 

Changes on the inside include updating seating areas with new fixtures, slightly larger bathrooms, a fresh coat of paint, and more efficient heating and cooling systems. Behind the scenes, the kitchen will be getting mechanical upgrades. The mascot’s smiling face and namesake will still be on two sides of the building but will be more modernized. The project is expected to be finished in February. 

Further down the road, Loard’s Ice Cream has been closed since December 17. A sign on the classic scoop shop says it should be reopened in two months (late February or March) with an improved eating experience. Gold Medallion Commercial Builders was hired as the main contractor. 

Founded by Russ Salyards in 1950, Loard’s debuted in Oakland but quickly expanded to San Leandro (where all of its ice cream is made) and Castro Valley in the early 1960s. The Castro Village Shopping Center's original site was where Phulkari Indian Cuisine currently sits. The ice cream shop moved across the parking lot to its current location in the 1980s. 

Ownership also recently passed hands from parents Wa and Chung Lung to their daughter Charlene, who promises to keep the original pink and white color scheme and fun artwork on the walls designed by Paul Matson. 

Across the street, the chain-link fence along the Paseo has been taken down at the Castro Valley Marketplace. Main Street Property Services, which manages the site to the east says they are preparing for a lot of changes in 2025. 

Spokesperson Craig Semmelmeyer tells the Forum that the property, which includes Knudsen’s Ice Creamery, Unincorporated clothiers, a couple of insurance properties, and the now-closed Joyful House, will be known as “Marketplace Shops.” 

He adds that the spaces that used to occupy Wend’s Vietnamese Pho Café and Fearless Martial Arts are preparing for two or three businesses, of which at least one will be a sit-down experience dining restaurant that opens to the Paseo.

Whether anyone can eat out there is another story. The Paseo is still the subject of litigation, with the property owners on both sides claiming rights to open seating arrangements. The disruptive chain-link fence was installed last fall to help upgrade some utilities and allow PG&E a space to review. 

The Main Street property group is preparing a lighting ceremony on Thursday, January 9, to extend the holiday season and acknowledge the changes, Semmelmeyer said.",https://mycvforum.com/recent-headlines/construction-brings-hope-in-the-new-year,real,0
"Construction Brings Hope in the New Year.

As the calendar flips to a new year, communities across the nation are witnessing a surge in construction projects that promise to reshape neighborhoods and bring renewed optimism. From affordable housing developments to revitalized public spaces, these initiatives are providing tangible signs of progress and hope for brighter days ahead.

One of the most transformative efforts is underway in Crestwood, a small city that has long grappled with a shortage of affordable housing. The construction of a 200-unit apartment complex, scheduled for completion in late 2025, aims to provide modern, affordable homes to hundreds of families. “This project is not just about buildings; it’s about building lives,” said Mayor Angela Carson. “We’re investing in our community’s future.”

Elsewhere, infrastructure projects are addressing longstanding issues. In Riverview County, a long-awaited bridge reconstruction is set to ease commutes for thousands of residents while improving safety and accessibility. For local business owner James Patel, the bridge is a game-changer. “This will bring more customers to our area, boosting the local economy and connecting communities,” Patel remarked.

Public spaces are also getting a makeover. In Greenfield, a new park is rising where an abandoned industrial site once stood. With walking trails, playgrounds, and open green spaces, the project symbolizes renewal for the town’s residents. “This park is a gift for future generations,” said local volunteer Maria Lopez, who has been involved in the park’s planning.

These construction projects are not without challenges. Rising costs and supply chain disruptions continue to impact timelines, but the determination to bring these initiatives to life remains strong. State and local governments have partnered with private organizations to secure funding and ensure these projects stay on track.

“Every beam laid and every brick placed is a step toward a stronger, more united community,” said Thomas Reed, a construction foreman working on a new community center in East Haven. “We’re building more than structures—we’re building hope.”

As the dust settles on construction sites and the outlines of these projects begin to take shape, the message is clear: progress is happening, and the future is brighter. For communities across the nation, the sound of hammers and drills is a sign of hope in the new year.",generate a news article that fits this title Construction Brings Hope in the New Year,fake,1
"Pittsburgh bridge collapses, drops city bus into ravine.

PITTSBURGH (AP) — A 50-year-old bridge collapsed in Pittsburgh early Friday, requiring rescuers to rappel down a ravine and form a human chain to reach a few occupants of a municipal bus that plummeted along with the span. No deaths were reported.

The collapse came hours before President Joe Biden arrived in the city to promote his $1 trillion infrastructure law, which has earmarked about $1.6 billion for Pennsylvania bridge maintenance.

At least four people required hospital treatment. Five other vehicles were also on the bridge at the time. The cause was being investigated, and crews searched under the debris for additional victims.

A large crack showed on the end of the bridge where the segmented bus landed 150 feet (46 meters) down in the ravine, as if hit by an earthquake. A car landed upside down in front of the bus, which was operated by the Pittsburgh area’s transit agency.

The Forbes Avenue bridge over Fern Hollow Creek in Frick Park came down at 6:39 a.m., city officials said. The loud noise from the collapse was followed by a hissing sound and the smell of natural gas, witnesses said.

“The first sound was much more intense, and kind of a rumbling, which I guess was the structure, the deck hitting the ground,” said Ken Doyno, a resident who lives four houses away. “I mean, the whole house rattled at that point.”

Ruptured gas lines along the bridge produced the leak, and the supply of gas was shut off within a half-hour, city officials said.

As Biden toured the scene, an officer told him a person who was running by helped first responders get people out of cars. He called it a miracle.

“It really is, it’s astounding,” Biden said.

By midafternoon, three adults were being treated, and all were in fair condition, the UPMC hospital system said. A fourth person had received treatment and was released.

The National Transportation Safety Board sent a team to investigate. The agency tweeted a photo late Friday of Chair Jennifer Homendy at the scene.

A search-and-rescue team combed the area, said Sam Wasserman, a spokesperson for Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey. Drones were brought in to help.

Most of the 10 people evaluated for injuries were first responders who were checked for exhaustion or because of the cold and snowy weather, Gainey said.

The segmented bus operated by the Port Authority of Allegheny County had two passengers in addition to the driver, said Adam Brandolph, spokesperson for the agency.

The bus driver, Daryl Luciani, told WPXI-TV that as soon as he reached the bridge, he believed it was collapsing.

“I could just feel it,” Luciani told the station. “The bus was bouncing and shaking and it seems long, but it was probably less than a minute that the bus finally came to a stop, and I was just thankful that nobody on the bus was hurt.”

The passengers appeared to be OK, he said, so he pulled the air brake and waited for help to arrive. First responders reached them after descending with flashlights in the predawn darkness and used a rope to help him and other occupants get to safety, Luciani said.

About two hours after the collapse, Brandolph said, one of the passengers was on another bus, began complaining of injuries and was taken to a hospital. The driver and other passenger were not hurt, according to Brandolph.

The bus had started its route in downtown Pittsburgh and had been heading to the suburban community of Braddock.

“Judging by the time of day, had this bus been traveling inbound, toward downtown, there likely would have been more people on the bus and obviously could have been a much, much more dire situation,” Brandolph said.

The bus had seven or eight cameras, and any footage they captured of the collapse will be part of the investigation, Brandolph said.

Neighbors said a gas company worker went door to door to get them to evacuate from the immediate vicinity before the gas was successfully shut off.

“Apart from just this abiding noise, we could begin to smell gas and that was the truly frightening thing, then with that smell we both said, let’s get dressed and get out of here,” said Lyn Krynski, whose home is nearest the bridge.

“It sounded like a weather phenomenon more than anything,” said Douglas Gwilym, who was shoveling about an inch of snow when he heard the noise. “It was all I had to compare it to — it was this odd, whooshing sound.”

The bridge is an important artery that leads to the Squirrel Hill and Oakland neighborhoods and is a popular route toward downtown Pittsburgh. Authorities told motorists to avoid the area. Several neighbors said a weather-prompted two-hour school delay may have prevented a far worse human tragedy.

At the site of the collapse, Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman called it “just an awful, surreal scene.”

“I hope it’s a wake-up call to the nation that we need to make these infrastructure investments,” Fetterman said.

The steel bridge, which was built in 1970, carries about 14,500 vehicles a day, according to a 2005 estimate.

Wasserman said the most recent inspection occurred in September but the report was not immediately available.

But a September 2019 inspection of the city-owned bridge revealed the deck and superstructure to be in poor condition, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Bridge Inventory.

A spreadsheet on the state Department of Transportation website listed the bridge’s overall condition as poor, which, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, means “deterioration of primary structural elements has advanced.”",https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-pittsburgh-bridge-collapses-b91476e4d1dc1c7839bd0c39e7be186e,real,0
"Pittsburgh bridge collapses, drops city bus into ravine.

In a shocking incident early this morning, a bridge in Pittsburgh collapsed, resulting in a city bus plummeting into a ravine below. The collapse occurred around 7:30 AM, during the busy morning commute, on the bridge that connects the eastern neighborhoods to the downtown area.

Eyewitnesses reported a loud crumbling sound followed by the sight of the bridge giving way. Emergency services were quick to respond to the scene, where they found the city bus, along with several vehicles, had been caught in the collapse.

Rescue operations commenced immediately, with firefighters and emergency medical technicians working to extract passengers from the wreckage. Preliminary reports indicate that several people were injured, though, fortunately, no fatalities have been reported so far.

The mayor of Pittsburgh has called for a thorough investigation into the cause of the collapse, citing concerns about the aging infrastructure of the city. The bridge, which was over 50 years old, had been reported for maintenance several times in the past years.

This collapse has raised alarms about the safety of other old bridges in the area. The city council has announced plans to review all bridges, particularly those built more than 50 years ago, to ensure their safety and functionality.

As the community reels from this unexpected disaster, the focus is now on the recovery efforts and ensuring the safety of its infrastructure to prevent future incidents.

"After fire in veterinary practice: New owners are empty-handed.

Last Friday's fire in Bad Zurzach has far-reaching consequences. Not only the home of the veterinarian couple Spörri has been damaged, but also the practice. This was about to be renovated and should have passed into new hands.

A nightmare happened to Vreni and Werner Spörri on Friday afternoon. The couple was on the ground floor of their house, which is only a stone's throw from the large thermal bath car park in Bad Zurzach. Suddenly, it ""used"" the fuses, Vreni Spörri tells TeleM1: ""We went up to see what had happened. The flames were already coming towards us on the second floor.""

Her husband tried to prevent the worst with the fire extinguisher, but in vain. The fire had broken out in the attic of the house. Fire burst out of the windows. The column of smoke could be seen from afar.

Extinguishing water causes additional damage
The house also houses the veterinary practice of the Spörri couple. The large amount of extinguishing water has destroyed it. As she walks through the house marked by the disaster, owner Vreni Spörri points to the walls where the water runs down: ""They're already making dents.""

The upper floors are also home to the Spörris. Or rather: were. After the fire, these rooms are uninhabitable, the veterinarian couple has taken up residence in a hotel. Meanwhile, the two are met with a lot of solidarity from the neighbourhood: ""The emotional comes in phases where you don't feel so well. But we have very nice neighbours who cook for us and also look out for us in other ways.""

Horror handover for the successors
Particularly bad: In about a week, the Spörris would have handed over their practice to their successors at Xenta's Tierärzte GmbH. ""It couldn't have been more stupid for them. We had already finished, but they are now left with nothing."" That is why they are now looking for a temporary location so that animal patients can be treated again as soon as possible.

With the new location for the new veterinary practice, however, it could take even longer. ""You have to meet certain requirements: you need water and electricity, the X-ray machine needs X-ray-tight walls with lead.""

So for the moment, all that remains is to be glad that neither animals nor humans have been harmed. According to the Aargau cantonal police, the cause of the fire is still unknown, and the investigations are ongoing.",https://www.nidwaldnerzeitung.ch/aargau/zurzibiet/bad-zurzach-nach-brand-in-tierarztpraxis-neue-besitzer-stehen-mit-leeren-haenden-da-ld.2325968,real,0
"After fire in veterinary practice: New owners are empty-handed.

In a tragic turn of events, a devastating fire consumed a popular veterinary practice in downtown Fairview last month, leaving the new owners grappling with significant losses and no recourse to rebuild. The incident has sent shockwaves through the community, which had long relied on the clinic for compassionate care for their pets.

The fire broke out in the early hours of December 12, reducing the facility to ashes despite the rapid response from local fire services. Investigations by the fire marshal have since concluded that the blaze was caused by an electrical fault in the building's aging wiring.

For the clinic’s new owners, Sarah and Ethan Walker, the fire has been nothing short of a nightmare. The couple purchased the practice just six months ago, pouring their life savings into what they believed would be a stable and fulfilling business venture.

“We’ve always dreamed of running a clinic that could make a real difference for animals and their families,” Sarah Walker said in an emotional interview. “Now, we’re left with nothing but heartbreak.”

Adding to their distress, the Walkers have discovered that their insurance policy does not cover the full extent of their losses. The policy, inherited from the previous owners, contained a clause that excluded electrical fires from coverage—a detail the Walkers overlooked during the purchase process.

“We trusted that everything was in place,” Ethan Walker explained. “We had no idea we were so vulnerable.”

Community members have rallied around the Walkers, organizing a crowdfunding campaign to help them recover. As of this week, the campaign has raised $32,000 of its $100,000 goal.

“This clinic has been a cornerstone of Fairview for decades,” said longtime client Denise Harper. “It’s our turn to support Sarah and Ethan as they’ve supported us.”

Despite the outpouring of support, the future remains uncertain for the Walkers. Rebuilding the clinic will require navigating a maze of financial, legal, and logistical challenges. Meanwhile, many of the clinic’s staff have been forced to seek employment elsewhere.

The Walkers remain determined to keep their dream alive. “It’s going to take time and a lot of hard work,” Sarah said. “But we’re not giving up. This community and its animals mean too much to us.”

Local officials have pledged to assist the Walkers in securing permits for rebuilding and exploring grant opportunities. Fairview Mayor Angela Martinez expressed her support, stating, “We’ll do everything we can to ensure this vital service returns to our community.”

For now, the charred remains of the clinic stand as a somber reminder of the fire’s devastation. But with the resilience of the Walkers and the backing of a supportive community, there is hope that the clinic will rise from the ashes stronger than ever.",generate a news article based on the article title: After fire in veterinary practice: New owners are empty-handed.,fake,1
"Fremont Police Bust Open Large-Scale Fraud.

Fremont Police Bust Open Large-Scale Fraud Operation
Fremont, CA – In a major crackdown on financial crime, the Fremont Police Department has dismantled a large-scale fraud operation that allegedly scammed individuals and businesses out of millions of dollars.

Authorities announced on Friday that a months-long investigation led to the arrest of multiple suspects involved in an elaborate fraud network operating within the Bay Area. The operation reportedly targeted unsuspecting victims through identity theft, financial fraud, and a complex web of shell companies.

""This is one of the largest fraud busts we have seen in recent years,"" said Police Chief Michael Carter during a press briefing. ""Our officers, along with federal agencies, worked tirelessly to bring these perpetrators to justice.""

How the Scheme Worked
According to investigators, the suspects employed a variety of fraudulent tactics, including phishing scams, credit card fraud, and business identity theft. Victims were tricked into providing sensitive personal and financial information, which was then used to create fake accounts, access bank funds, and make unauthorized purchases.

In some cases, authorities discovered that fraudsters had also engaged in elaborate Ponzi schemes, promising high returns on investments that never materialized. Police say they have identified dozens of victims, including small business owners who unknowingly became entangled in the scheme.

Massive Raid Unveils Fraud Network
The bust took place early Thursday morning, when law enforcement, including Fremont Police, the FBI, and the California Department of Justice, executed multiple search warrants across the city. Raids were conducted at several commercial and residential locations, leading to the seizure of electronic devices, fraudulent documents, and a substantial amount of cash.

At least eight individuals have been arrested and face charges that include conspiracy to commit fraud, wire fraud, and identity theft.

Community Impact and Warnings
Authorities are urging anyone who suspects they may have been a victim of this fraud operation to come forward.

""We encourage residents and businesses to stay vigilant, report suspicious activity, and protect their personal information,"" said Detective Lisa Ramirez of the Fremont Police Fraud Division.

Local officials have also warned of a rise in cyber and financial crimes, urging individuals to take extra precautions when dealing with online transactions and investment offers.

What’s Next?
The arrested suspects are currently being held at the Alameda County Jail, with bail hearings expected in the coming days. If convicted, they could face significant prison time. Investigators believe more individuals may be involved in the operation and are continuing their efforts to identify additional suspects.

Fremont Police have set up a dedicated fraud hotline for potential victims to report their cases and seek assistance.

"Utility Crews Respond To Water Break Near White Rock.

WHITE ROCK – Utility crews were dispatched early Saturday morning to address a significant water main break near the White Rock neighborhood, disrupting water service for hundreds of residents.

The rupture, which occurred around 3:30 a.m., was located along the 1500 block of Lakeview Drive, sending torrents of water flowing onto nearby streets and creating minor flooding in some areas. City officials reported that the break likely resulted from aging infrastructure combined with recent fluctuations in temperature.

“Our crews are working diligently to isolate the affected section of the water main and minimize service interruptions,” said Jamie Carter, a spokesperson for the city’s Department of Public Works. “We’re prioritizing repairs to restore water service as quickly and safely as possible.”

Affected residents were notified of the outage through emergency alerts and advised to use bottled water or boil tap water as a precaution until service is fully restored. The city has also set up a temporary water distribution site at the White Rock Community Center for those in need.

Local businesses in the area are also feeling the impact, with several cafes and restaurants temporarily closing due to the lack of running water. “We’re hoping the repairs will be completed soon so we can get back to serving our customers,” said Emily Rojas, owner of a nearby coffee shop.

Public Works officials estimate that repairs could take up to 12 hours, but the timeline remains fluid as crews assess the extent of the damage. The city has urged residents to stay clear of the repair site for safety reasons and to allow workers to complete their tasks without interruption.

The incident has renewed calls for investment in upgrading the city’s aging water infrastructure. “This is a wake-up call,” said local councilmember Sarah Lopez. “We need to prioritize modernizing our water systems to prevent future disruptions and ensure reliability for our residents.”

As of midday, no injuries have been reported, but the city’s emergency management team continues to monitor the situation closely.

"Santa Clara school district slapped with discrimination complaint.

Civil rights organizations have filed a Title VI complaint against a local school district for alleged discrimination against Palestinian students, parents and educators.

Santa Clara Unified School District will be facing a federal civil rights complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Education. The complaint alleges school officials engaged in or permitted actions which created a hostile educational environment, failed to address students’ safety concerns and suppressed Palestinian perspectives in the classroom. SCUSD spokesperson Jennifer Dericco said the district heard a complaint was filed with the Office of Civil Rights, but hasn’t been formally served. In the meantime, the district has started its own investigation. 

The San Francisco Bay Area Office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), National Lawyers Guild San Francisco Bay Area, American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and Arab Resource and Organizing Center jointly submitted the complaint.

CAIR San Francisco Bay Area Executive Director Zahra Billoo said students are concerned their advocacy for human rights is being silenced.

“People are reporting that if they are Palestinian or pro-Palestine, they’re facing targeting or repression at school,” she told San José Spotlight. “That’s left the students feeling as though they don’t have a space to have conversations about who they are and what they feel.” 

When the Muslim Student Association at Wilcox High School in the district wanted to invite Palestinian community leader Samir Laymoun to speak, Billoo said administrators asked them to notify the Jewish Culture Club — and asked Laymoun not to mention Gaza.

“That itself raised a lot of red flags,” Billoo said. “The school’s heavy handedness in determining who students could invite as a guest speaker and then strictly limiting what the speaker could say.”

Ran Bar-Yoshafat, deputy director of Israeli nonprofit think tank Kohelet Policy Forum, wasn’t limited in his remarks when he was scheduled to speak, Billoo said, and the Muslim Student Association wasn’t asked for approval. Billoo wants the school district to establish an equitable vetting process for speakers and a task force on anti-Palestinian racism and Islamophobia.

“My understanding is that both student club organizations and their guest speakers followed the same process,” Dericco told San José Spotlight. 

The Department of Education will assess the Title VI complaint to determine if it will open an investigation. If they don’t, Billoo said other advocacy will be explored.

Dericco said the district is committed to equity, empathy and respect. Schools are diverse, she said, and strive to create environments where students, teachers and staff feel a sense of safety and belonging.

Billoo said a woman who set up a Palestinian booth at Laurelwood Elementary School’s multicultural festival had a confrontation with an Israeli parent and administrators didn’t address it. Parent Wala Zaytoun, who created the booth, said a parent accused her of lying while tearing the Palestinian flag from her child’s festival passport. The parent’s action was in response to Zaytoun labeling a map of Israel the “Palestinian World Map.”

“I’m from that land,” Zaytoun said. “My ancestors are from that land.”

At a Santa Clara Unified School District board meeting in April, Israeli parents said they were horrified to see the entire map of Israel presented as Palestine, which implied the eradication of Jewish people. The booth’s passport stamp said “Free Palestine” and had a poster noting how many Palestinian children have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war.

Parent Galit Perez-Rashef said the booth shared misinformation and presented difficult content that distressed students.

“I’m saddened this beautiful event was used for political propaganda,” Perez-Rashef said. “People in my community were hurt.”

Parent Dan Yamin urged the board to take action against antisemitism at school.

“I was really in shock in Laurelwood, in an elementary school, that would be the case,” he said. “It is so sad to me.”

The board said it will create guidelines for future events regarding content on controversial subjects.

Even though the multicultural event didn’t go as planned for Zaytoun, she pointed out the school has an embracing philosophy.

“Everyone is welcome,” Zaytoun told San José Spotlight. “That’s what the school says. It does make a difference when you’re Palestinian.”",https://sanjosespotlight.com/santa-clara-school-district-slapped-with-discrimination-complaint/,real,0
"Santa Clara school district slapped with discrimination complaint.

SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA — A group of parents and community advocates has filed a formal discrimination complaint against the Santa Clara Unified School District, alleging that minority and special-needs students are being systematically denied equal educational opportunities. The complaint, submitted to both the California Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, has ignited debate among district families and prompted the school board to respond to what they call “serious and concerning allegations.”

According to the complaint, Black, Latino, and students with special needs have been disproportionately disciplined and denied access to critical learning resources. Parents behind the complaint claim that these inequities have led to significant academic gaps and emotional strain. “Our children have a right to a safe, supportive environment,” said Sara González, a parent involved in filing the complaint. “We want the district to prioritize the well-being and success of every student, regardless of background or ability.”

The allegations detail incidents in which students with learning disabilities were left without proper accommodations, and in which teachers and administrators reportedly failed to address bullying directed at minority students. One family alleges that their child was pulled out of mainstream classes without notice and placed in a lower-level program. “They basically labeled my son a troublemaker rather than addressing his learning needs,” said the child’s mother, who requested anonymity.

District officials, including Superintendent Dr. Kara Simmons, issued a brief statement acknowledging the complaint and expressing a commitment to a thorough investigation. “We take any claims of discrimination very seriously,” Simmons said. “Our district is committed to ensuring an equitable education for all students, and we will cooperate fully with the investigation to address any concerns.”

Nevertheless, some community members are pushing back against the complaint, claiming that the district has made strides in recent years to improve equity. “We’ve introduced new training programs for teachers, hired additional counselors, and fostered diverse student clubs,” said School Board President Malik Brown. “We’re confident our record will demonstrate that any claims of systemic discrimination do not reflect the district’s values.”

Next steps will depend on the findings of the state and federal investigations. If the agencies determine that the complaint has merit, they may require the district to enact corrective measures such as expanding support services or revising disciplinary policies. Meanwhile, parents and advocacy groups say they are prepared to pursue legal action if they feel the district fails to address the concerns outlined in the complaint.

As the investigations unfold, the Santa Clara Unified School District—and the broader community—are left grappling with how best to ensure that all students receive fair treatment, high-quality education, and a safe space to thrive.",generate a news article with the title Santa Clara school district slapped with discrimination complaint,fake,1
"National Quitters Day: Tips for keeping your fitness resolutions on track.

January 11, 2025

Every year, the second Friday in January is dubbed “National Quitters Day,” marking the point when many people abandon their New Year’s resolutions—especially fitness goals. Whether it’s the pull of cozy winter evenings or the challenge of breaking old habits, staying committed can be tough. But don’t hang up your running shoes just yet! With the right mindset and strategies, you can overcome the Quitters Day slump and keep your fitness resolutions alive.

Why Do Resolutions Fizzle Out?

Studies show that about 80% of New Year’s resolutions fail by mid-February, with most people giving up much earlier. Common reasons include setting overly ambitious goals, lack of a clear plan, and struggling to maintain motivation after the initial excitement fades.

Personal trainer Jessica Harris explains, “The key to sticking with your goals is creating sustainable habits. Motivation will come and go, but routines are what carry you through.”

Tips to Stay on Track
	1.	Start Small and Build Momentum
Break your resolution into manageable steps. Instead of pledging to work out every day, start with three times a week. As you build confidence, gradually increase the intensity or frequency.
	2.	Set Specific, Achievable Goals
Swap vague resolutions like “get fit” for clear goals, such as “run a 5K by April” or “attend two yoga classes per week.” Specificity helps track progress and celebrate milestones.
	3.	Find an Accountability Partner
Team up with a friend, family member, or coworker who shares similar goals. Having someone to check in with or exercise alongside can boost commitment and make the journey more enjoyable.
	4.	Use Technology to Stay Motivated
Fitness apps and wearable trackers can help you monitor progress, set reminders, and celebrate small victories. Many apps also offer community features to connect with others on the same path.
	5.	Celebrate Small Wins
Reward yourself for progress—whether it’s hitting a new personal best or sticking to your routine for a month. Treat yourself to something that aligns with your goals, like new workout gear or a massage.
	6.	Anticipate Obstacles
Identify potential roadblocks and plan how to overcome them. For example, if time is an issue, consider 20-minute home workouts or early morning sessions before the day gets busy.
	7.	Remember Your “Why”
Reflect on why you set your fitness goal in the first place. Whether it’s to feel healthier, gain energy, or reduce stress, keeping your motivation front and center can help you push through tough days.

Don’t Be Discouraged by Setbacks

Slip-ups are normal and don’t mean you’ve failed. “Progress is not about perfection,” says Harris. “The important thing is to get back on track and keep moving forward.”

A Movement Toward Resilience

National Quitters Day is a reminder that many people struggle with resolutions—but it’s also an opportunity to recommit and find strategies that work for you. With patience and persistence, your fitness goals can become long-lasting habits.

"National Quitters Day: Tips for keeping your fitness resolutions on track.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (CBS19 NEWS) — The second Friday in January is known as “National Quitters Day,” a day when many people give up on their New Year’s resolutions. If that’s you, don’t worry—local fitness experts have advice on how to pick up where you left off.

Planet Fitness manager Alexandria Zyderveld says the New Year is always an exciting time at the gym. “Everybody is coming in. We see a much higher traffic volume at the New Year’s always. And, you know, our goal here is to keep helping you be motivated,” she said.

But that enthusiasm often fades as the weeks go by. Will Paget-Brown, the owner of Iron Will Gym, says this is often due to unrealistic goals.

“I would much rather someone take what we call the minimum effective amount. If you can get into the gym two times a week, settle on those two times, focus on those two times, really get into a rhythm, and then, once you dial that in, you can see, do you need to add in any more,” he said.

Zyderveld shares some tips to stay on track. “The most important part of sticking to your goals is just remembering that you wanted that goal in the first place and you put that mindset. You've already started and done the first hardest step in that, saying, ‘Okay, I want to focus on fitness,’” she said.

So while the second Friday in January may be dubbed National Quitters Day, it doesn’t have to mark the end of your fitness journey—because the only thing worth quitting is the habit of giving up.

“There’s no age limit. You can start at 18 to 93. Multiple members. All ages, shapes, and sizes. There's no time to start. Do it now,” Zyderveld added.

Because it’s about more than just getting bigger muscles. “There’s always a benefit to bone health. There’s always a benefit to heart health, and it’s certainly never too late to start seeing those benefits,” says Paget-Brown.

And a healthy body equals a healthy mind. “Sometimes it's about coming and doing your mental health too. So don't always think about it as just your physical muscle health, because your brain is a muscle too,” Zyderveld said.

Whether you're just starting, a few weeks in, or picking up where you left off, experts say the hardest part is showing up—the rest is progress.",https://www.cbs19news.com/news/national-quitters-day-tips-for-keeping-your-fitness-resolutions-on-track/article_505ab422-d044-11ef-97a0-8788fa0fef16.html,real,0
"Ethiopia’s maiden stock exchange finally opens trading floor.

Wegagen Bank among first to list
Ethiopia’s long-anticipated stock exchange went live on Friday, marking a turning point for an economy struggling with low access to finance. Banking gurus, economists, and investors who have advocated for a stock market in past decades have hailed the inauguration of the Ethiopian Securities Exchange (ESX) as historic.
Despite being home to one of the largest economies in Sub-Saharan Africa and the second-largest population on the continent, Ethiopia has not had a secondary market since the socialist Derg regime shuttered a rudimentary securities exchange that opened in the final decades of the Imperial era.
Plans to revive the secondary market began to gather pace following the political upheaval of 2018, which marked the start of an economic liberalization process that was off the table under EPRDF administration.
Major preparational work like establishing the Ethiopian Capital Market Authority and ratification of institutional and legal frameworks were finalized over the last two-and-a-half years. Although the stock market’s inauguration has been delayed several times, the ESX floor finally opened this week.
Officials want to see ESX host at least 90 initial public offerings (IPOs) in the coming years. Shares, equity, and debt securities will be traded on the platform. Banks, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and other eligible firms are eligible to list.
Wegagen Bank has become among the first to offer equity on ESX, sources told The Reporter.
Ethio telecom’s 10 percent stake offering is slated to go live on ESX, while at least four other SOEs under the Ethiopian Investment Holdings (EIH) are also expected to list.
The inauguration ceremony on Friday was organized by the Office of the Prime Minister and saw the attendance of Abiy Ahmed and other senior officials. The ceremony was closed to mainstream media, and attendees were prohibited from taking photos or recording videos.
“In a historic milestone for our economic and financial landscape, we have officially rung the bell to launch the Ethiopian Securities Exchange, the first stock exchange for our country. Invest in Ethiopia, a fast-growing economy with immense potential and a dynamic trajectory toward prosperity,” reads a social media post from the PM.
During the ceremony, he said that “investors should not worry. The government has many giant state enterprises. In the past couple of years, we have undertaken serious preparations in order to launch a successful stock exchange and avoid any chance of failures.”
Tilahun Kassahun, CEO of the Exchange, stated the market would not have been realized without the economic reforms of the past few years, as well as the launch of the digital National ID.
The banking industry is likely to be the first to brave the new market. An estimated 400,000 shareholders hold equity in the country’s commercial banks, and they will now be able to sell and buy shares on ESX at any time.
Companies also will be able to issue debt securities, which so far have been limited to treasury bonds issued by the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE).
Regulators have been busy digitizing existing equity and stock records, which should be accessible in real time via the ESX platform.
The stock exchange is Sharia-compliant, with products like sukuk. It will be the third-largest sharia compliant stock exchange in Africa, according to Tilahun.
“We will reach the milestone that stock exchanges like those of Nigeria and Egypt achieved in a short time,” added Tilahun.",https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/43322/,real,0
"Ethiopia’s maiden stock exchange finally opens trading floor.

ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - In a historic moment for East Africa's largest economy, the Ethiopian Securities Exchange (ESX) officially commenced operations today, marking a significant milestone in the country's journey toward financial modernization and economic liberalization.
The pristine trading floor, located in the heart of Addis Ababa's bustling financial district, buzzed with energy as Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed rang the ceremonial opening bell at 9:00 AM local time. The moment was met with thunderous applause from gathered dignitaries, including central bank officials, corporate leaders, and international financial representatives.
""Today marks not just the opening of a trading floor, but the dawn of a new era in Ethiopia's economic history,"" declared Prime Minister Abiy in his inaugural address. ""The ESX will serve as a crucial platform for capital formation, helping our businesses grow and enabling ordinary Ethiopians to participate in our nation's prosperity.""
The exchange debuts with seven companies listed on its main board, including the state-owned Ethiopian Airlines, Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, and several private enterprises from the telecommunications and manufacturing sectors. The initial public offerings have already generated unprecedented interest from both domestic and foreign investors, with subscription rates exceeding expectations.
Dr. Eyob Tesfaye, Chairman of the Ethiopian Capital Markets Authority, emphasized the robust regulatory framework put in place to ensure market integrity. ""We have implemented state-of-the-art trading systems and adopted international best practices in market surveillance and risk management,"" he explained. ""Our partnership with the London Stock Exchange Group has been instrumental in establishing these systems.""
The trading floor itself is a testament to Ethiopia's ambitions. The 50,000-square-foot facility features cutting-edge technology, including real-time price display boards, dedicated trading terminals, and a sophisticated market surveillance system. The exchange has also implemented a fully electronic clearing and settlement system to ensure efficient post-trade operations.
For local businesses, the ESX represents a new frontier in capital raising. Zewdu Mengiste, CEO of Aurora Manufacturing, one of the first companies to list on the exchange, shared his optimism: ""Access to capital has been a major constraint for Ethiopian businesses. The ESX provides us with an alternative to traditional bank financing and opens doors to a wider pool of investors.""
The exchange has already attracted significant interest from the Ethiopian diaspora, with special provisions made to facilitate their participation in the market. ""We expect the diaspora to play a crucial role in the success of our capital markets,"" noted Melaku Kebede, CEO of ESX. ""Their investment will not only provide needed capital but also bring international expertise and corporate governance standards.""
International financial institutions have welcomed Ethiopia's move. The International Monetary Fund's representative in Ethiopia praised the development as ""a crucial step toward financial sector deepening and economic diversification."" Several global investment banks have already established local partnerships to facilitate foreign investment through the exchange.
Looking ahead, the ESX has ambitious plans for growth. The exchange aims to list 50 companies within its first three years of operation and introduce new financial instruments, including corporate bonds and eventually derivatives. Plans are also underway to establish connections with other African exchanges to facilitate cross-border trading.
The establishment of the ESX comes as part of Ethiopia's broader economic reforms, which include liberalizing previously state-dominated sectors and modernizing the country's financial system. The exchange is expected to play a pivotal role in mobilizing domestic savings and attracting foreign investment, crucial elements in Ethiopia's vision of becoming a middle-income country by 2025.
As trading commenced, the ESX All-Share Index showed strong performance, with particularly robust activity in the banking and manufacturing sectors. The successful launch of Ethiopia's stock exchange not only represents a major achievement for the country but also strengthens Africa's capital markets landscape, potentially serving as a model for other emerging economies in the region.
The exchange will operate Monday through Friday, from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM local time, with plans to extend trading hours as market activity increases.

"West Virginia lawmakers oust delegate-elect on house arrest who made terroristic threats.

A West Virginia delegate-elect was ousted Wednesday while confined to his house on charges related to terroristic threats against his colleagues.

Joseph de Soto, who recently became a Democrat, was elected in November to represent the southern part of Berkeley County in West Virginia's 91st district as a Republican. He was arrested in December after saying God had called on him to kill several members of the Legislature, including House Speaker Roger Hanshaw and House Majority Leader Pat McGeehan, who are both Republicans.

"Purcellville town manager fired; to be replaced by former Mayor Fraser.

In a surprising move that has left the small town of Purcellville reeling, the town’s manager, Greg Anderson, was dismissed from his position by the Town Council earlier this week. The firing comes just months after Anderson's contract was renewed and amid growing concerns about the town’s management and future development.

The decision was announced during a special Town Council meeting on Thursday, where Council members voted unanimously to part ways with Anderson, who had served as town manager for three years. Council members cited a ""lack of alignment"" with the town's long-term goals and a failure to effectively communicate with staff and residents as the primary reasons for his dismissal. Sources within the council also mentioned ""a series of operational and financial challenges"" that occurred under his watch, though specifics were not immediately provided.

Anderson, who took the job in 2022 after a career in local government management in several Virginia towns, reportedly expressed disappointment but vowed to assist with the transition process. “I have always put the town's interests first, and while I disagree with the decision, I am committed to ensuring a smooth handover to my successor,” Anderson said in a statement following the announcement.

In a swift move to stabilize the leadership, the Town Council appointed former Mayor Frank Fraser as Anderson’s replacement. Fraser, who served as Purcellville's mayor from 2014 to 2022, was widely praised for his leadership during a period of growth and development for the town. The council cited Fraser’s deep understanding of Purcellville’s unique needs and challenges, as well as his strong relationship with local residents and business owners, as key factors in his selection.

“Frank is the right person for this moment in Purcellville’s history,” said Council Chairwoman Emily Reynolds. “His experience, knowledge, and commitment to this town are unparalleled. We are confident that under his guidance, Purcellville will continue to thrive.”

Fraser, who left office after choosing not to seek a third term as mayor, expressed eagerness to return to public service. ""I’m honored to once again serve this incredible community,"" he said. ""We have a lot of important work ahead of us, and I look forward to collaborating with the council, staff, and residents to ensure that Purcellville remains a vibrant and welcoming place for all.""

His appointment has already stirred up strong reactions. Supporters of Fraser have celebrated his return, citing his role in revitalizing downtown Purcellville and fostering a sense of unity among the town's diverse population. Critics, however, have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as Fraser’s ties to local developers and businesses during his time as mayor may require heightened scrutiny in his new role.

Some residents have also questioned whether the decision to fire Anderson was politically motivated, especially given that the council now has a majority of members aligned with the more conservative faction of the town's electorate. However, Reynolds dismissed these claims, emphasizing that the council’s decision was based solely on professional considerations.

With Fraser taking the helm, the town now faces the challenge of navigating ongoing infrastructure projects, including the long-awaited improvements to Route 7, as well as addressing the growing concerns over affordable housing and zoning. Fraser's prior tenure saw notable successes in economic development and community outreach, but also left some unfinished business that he will likely seek to address in his new role.

As Purcellville prepares for a new chapter in its leadership, all eyes will be on Fraser to see how he handles the town’s future growth and development. His first day on the job is scheduled for next Monday.

"Purcellville town manager fired; to be replaced by former Mayor Fraser.

In the Purcellville Town Council’s first action by the new majority team led by Mayor Chris Bertaut, the council voted 4-3 to fire town manager Rick Bremseth and hire former Mayor Kwasi Fraser as the interim town manager.

Councilmembers Carl “Ben” Nett, Susan Khalil and Carol Luke joined Bertaut in supporting the motion. Councilmembers Caleb Stought, Kevin Wright and Erin Rayner voted no.

The Jan. 8 special meeting began with a request by Councilmember Kevin Wright to hold the discussions about Bremseth in an open meeting.

However, that motion failed — by a 4-3 vote — and the council went into a closed session.

After about a 30-minute closed meeting, councilmembers returned to the dais and Stought requested an opportunity for discussion before the vote.

Stought asked Bertaut how the decision to replace Bremseth was reached and said it did not happen among all members of the town council in a public forum.

Bertaut said the decision was reached in discussions over the past several months with the new majority of the town council. He said interviews for the interim town manager took place individually over a period of several months.

“We wanted an individual to take the best path forward in order to achieve these goals and objectives,” Bertaut said.

Rayner said she was “absolutely shocked how unethical this process is and what has transpired.

“That you have met and considered the future of this town privately, that is incredibly unethical. We should not even be here tonight to vote on these items,” she said. “This is not transparent and I am very disappointed.”

Wright called the decision the “definition of corruption.”

“It was predetermined and forced down the citizens’ throats with the weak excuse of being what we were elected to do,” Wright said. “No one was elected to put this town in a bad light. We are going to be the laughing stock of Virginia and most likely the U.S. I promise we are going backwards.”

Khalil said she supports the decision, based on her review of the town’s financial information.

“In my campaign I scoured through financial information and could not figure out why some things had happened or were happening,” she said.

She did not state specifically what those items were.

“There could be no explanation for the existence of what I was seeing for them to be endorsed by the current town manager,” she said. “I support Fraser’s vision for the town. He is extremely knowledgeable about how to turn things around.”

Luke said the town has been through this several times, and she supported making a change now and moving forward with interviews for a new town manager at a later time.

“I think it is appropriate that we do this and move forward for Mr. Bremseth’s sake and for the town’s sake,” she said.

"How a Jewish neighborhood in liberal Los Angeles became a stronghold for Trump.

Rabbi Mordechai Teller can’t bring himself to tell his parents he voted for Donald Trump. He grew up in a liberal Jewish household in Los Angeles, and had voted for Democrats in previous elections. But he didn’t trust Kamala Harris on issues of Jewish security, and over the years, he had become disaffected with the party that nominated her.
Teller likened his adoption of conservative politics to someone coming out of the closet — a gradual awakening leading up to a great leap. Except when it came to his parents.
“It would almost be easier for me if I told them I was gay than me telling them I voted red, to be quite honest,” Teller, 43, said with a laugh. He paused, considering it. “Yeah, it would have been. They would accept me more if I said I’m gay.”
Teller, who runs an Orthodox outreach organization, lives in Pico-Robertson, a neighborhood on LA’s Westside that is home to thousands of Orthodox Jews, and he is hardly alone in his change of heart. Notwithstanding surveys that show Orthodox Jews predominantly identifying as conservative, precinct maps showed Pico-Robertson as solidly blue in previous elections. Roughly three in four voters there backed Hillary Clinton in 2016; in 2020, about two out of three went for Joe Biden.
In 2024, for the first time, parts of Pico-Robertson turned red. Its two largest precincts swung for Trump, who received about 51% of the votes compared to 44% for Harris; on the LA Times’ electoral map of the city, those precincts connect with Beverly Hills — which has picked Trump since 2016 — to form an island the color of salmon in a blue urban sea.
Pico-Robertson is not an officially defined geographic area — it’s named for a major intersection that forms its rough middle-point — and data on who lives there is limited. A survey by the local Jewish federation, which looked at the ZIP code most closely overlapping with the neighborhood, estimated about 24,500 Jews living there in 2021; the 2020 U.S. census put the total residents in that ZIP code at just over 30,000. How many of those Jews identify as Orthodox or Sephardic was unclear.
Whatever their percentage of the total, Orthodox Pico-Robertson’s numbers are growing, and by all accounts, the community is increasingly voting as a conservative bloc. Rabbi Elazar Muskin, who leads Young Israel of Century City, one of the oldest and largest synagogues in the neighborhood, estimated that up to 90% of his congregation voted for Trump, largely because of Israel. “They really felt Biden and Harris just not supporting Israel in its time of need as it needed to be supported,” Muskin told me. The sentiment is also visible on the street, outside Jewish homes with Trump yard signs or Trump flags hanging in the window.
The precinct maps tell a story of a political change seen all over the country in 2024, as voters with concerns about inflation, crime and immigration — and in the Orthodox Jewish world, a frustration with mixed messaging from Democrats after Oct. 7 — looked to Trump for change. But the maps also reflect a demographic change in the neighborhood. In other words, it is not only that longtime Democrats like Teller changed their vote. It is also that the voters themselves have changed. As yeshivish and Mizrahi Jews — those of Middle Eastern or North African heritage — have established a greater presence in Pico-Robertson, the neighborhood has attracted and become increasingly defined by a conservative culture and electorate.
Though still tentpoled by large Ashkenazi Modern Orthodox institutions like Muskin’s, Pico-Robertson’s Orthodox community is today more decentralized, ethnically diverse and deeply observant, with a booming Persian population, as well as emergent Chabad, Hasidic and yeshiva-educated crowds. There are new shuls for all of them.
These ascendant sub-communities lean heavily conservative. A poll of Orthodox voters by Nishma Research in September found 93% of Haredi voters supporting Trump; while data on the Persian Jewish community’s politics is harder to come by, community leaders say the numbers are similarly stark.
“There’s a correlation between the creation of these shuls and the arrival of a new demographic constituency,” said David Myers, a professor of Jewish history at UCLA who co-authored the Nishma study and a Pico-Robertson resident. One of the new shuls, a French Moroccan congregation called Magen Avot, occupies a storefront that once held a kosher seafood market. “From gefilte fish to Moroccan spiced fish,” he mused.
A surge of migration after World War II gave Pico-Robertson its Jewish identity, but for decades it was largely a liberal, traditional one — more kosher-style than kosher certified. As an Ashkenazi, Modern Orthodox community began to take shape beginning in the 1980s, a mile-and-a-half stretch of Pico Boulevard grew into the hub of Orthodox life in the western United States. Synagogues, day schools, glatt markets, nonprofits and a borderline-sinful array of kosher dining options now attract Orthodox migrants and tourists from all over the world.
The frum-ification is still unfolding, as Orthodox outposts steadily crop up where secular spots once stood. Stan’s Produce became a Chabad synagogue. A chandelier boutique became a kosher grocer. Beverlywood Bakery — est. 1946; famous for its rugelach, but nonkosher — is now a Hasidic shtiebel. These amenities have driven up demand for housing to the extent that a teardown in Pico-Robertson now starts at $1.7 million, a local real estate agent told me.
Emerging to serve — and develop — an increasingly observant crowd in Pico-Robertson is a hallmark institution of the yeshiva world: the kollel. A vestige of Jewish life in Eastern Europe, kollels pay young men — often fresh out of yeshiva — to learn and teach Torah full-time to adults in the community. There are now at least five kollels in Pico-Robertson doing outreach; one of them meets in what was once a Chase bank, whose logo and opening hours are still on its glass doors.
The proliferation of kollels has given the Modern Orthodox community a yeshiva-world flavor. Noting that his own congregants have become more active in prayer and Torah study over the years, Rabbi Muskin said Orthodoxy’s move toward what he called “modern-yeshivish” was a national phenomenon driven by the accessibility of Orthodox education at day schools, high schools and gap-year programs.
“There’s more education, so there’s more observance,” Muskin said. “You’re sending kids to yeshiva, and then you’re sending them out to Eretz Yisrael. They’re getting inspired in Israel. I have kids that grew up here that are very yeshivish today.”
The most visible of the kollels, Los Angeles Intercommunity Kollel — known as LINK — has expanded since moving to Pico Boulevard in 2006. Rabbi Teller, the Democrat-turned-Trump voter, taught classes there before branching out on his own; Rabbi Mordechai Lebhar, LINK’s rosh kollel, or head, also leads Magen Avot, Myers’ “Moroccan spiced fish” synagogue.
Lebhar told me that the kollel graduates — often imported from the East Coast — have tended to stay in town, taking jobs at the local day schools and starting families here. “Kollelim are an integral part of the growth of the community,” he said. “When there’s a kollel, it attracts younger families because they know there’s places they can learn, for men and for women.”
This was the first U.S. presidential election in which Lebhar, a Toronto native who first moved to Los Angeles to study at LINK, voted as a U.S. citizen. He was not a Trump acolyte, he said, but he was not electing a role model. “If you want to go hire a lawyer, so you’ll hire the best lawyer that’ll win you the case, whether he’s a mushchas or not,” Lebhar told me, using a Yiddish word that roughly translates to dirtbag. “According to what logic dictates will be better for Torah values, right now it’s the Republican party.”
The ascendance of Persian Orthodox Judaism
Four blocks west of LINK, where a barbershop once stood, stands Shuvah Israel Torah Center, a Persian synagogue known as a “minyan factory” because it offers morning prayer services every half-hour from 6:15 to 9:45 a.m. on weekdays. Each of those eight services by definition has at least 10 men; the ones I ducked into last week attained that many comfortably.
When Rabbi David Zargari arrived in Los Angeles 38 years ago, finding enough Sephardic shulgoers for just a single daily minyan was a task. Zargari, the first Iranian to attend the prestigious Haredi yeshiva Ner Israel in Baltimore, originally planned to return to Iran after graduation. But the Iranian Revolution scrambled those plans, and Zargari was dispatched instead to do outreach in LA, home to the largest Persian Jewish community in the U.S.
When they immigrated to the U.S., most Persian Jews joined Conservative synagogues, and Zargari said the notion of Orthodoxy struck first-generation immigrants as “Ashkenazi propaganda.” But within a few years of his opening Torat Hayim Hebrew Academy on Robertson Boulevard in 1987, hundreds of students were enrolled. The education they received was a Haredi one, even if their background was traditional.
As those students grew up and started their own families, Torat Hayim classrooms were increasingly filled with students from Sabbath-observant homes. By 2015, Zargari said, the transformation was complete. Some of his pupils have gone on to start their own shuls; one of them meets in LINK’s old building. Others help make quorum on weekday mornings at Shuvah Israel.
“There was a time my wife used to say that when she would see a black hat, she knew I’m coming home,” Zargari, 71, said. “I was really the first black hat in the Pico area. Now Pico has become much more black hat and much more yeshivish.”
While Pew’s 2020 survey of American Jews reported that 75% of American Orthodox Jews leaned Republican, it did not produce a Sephardic sample large enough to provide statistics on that community, the report’s lead author told me. It said 3% of American Jews identified as Sephardic, and 1% as Mizrahi. It did not offer statistics on Persian Jews at all.
But Zargari didn’t need a Pew survey to know how they would vote. “Persian Jews,” he said, “are all Republican. Republicans are much closer to us. Because Republicans have traditional values about family. And also Persian Jews are all ultra-Zionists, and they see how Obama and Biden mistreated Netanyahu. Trump is the one that brought the embassy to Jerusalem.”
“We try to push them to vote,” Zargari added. “I said, you have to vote. And they said, ‘OK, California, it’s all blue anyway’ — no. Baruch Hashem, he got the popular vote this year also. Our votes helped that.”
The formation of a new voting bloc
Israel was always the first political issue people in Pico-Robertson brought up when I showed them the election maps. Antisemitism was usually the second. But the litany of Orthodox Jewish grievances about Democratic leadership rarely ended there: crime, inflation and the culture wars all contributed to discontent.
“They’re very into the American issues,” Lebhar, the LINK rabbi, said of his community. “The economy. The woke stuff — people are sick of it.” He added: “A lot of the Jewish community, especially the frum Jewish community, that usually didn’t vote in the past, came out and voted. They were very passionate about what was going on.”
Popular vote notwithstanding, it’s hard to see an Orthodox community that makes up about a tenth of the American Jewish population — which is itself less than 3% of the national population — swinging a presidential election. But community organizers see the 2024 election as a proof of concept for local races, too.
In the months leading up to the election, Miriam Mark reached out to thousands of Jewish voters as a grassroots organizer for the Teach Coalition, an advocacy group founded by the Orthodox Union. While the group describes itself as an education lobby, in Los Angeles it focused on crime, and in particular the district attorney race, where George Gascon, an embattled left-wing incumbent, was up against a Jewish former prosecutor who vowed a tougher approach on crime.
Teach volunteers hit 40 synagogues and schools in LA, many in the Pico-Robertson area, and a community-wide “We Vote Shabbat” the weekend before the election encouraged early voting. Gascon’s opponent, Nathan Hochman, won easily.
The long-term goal of the organization is to secure government funding for Jewish day schools and yeshivas, Mark told me. But she is also envisioning a more broadly powerful endgame: an activated Jewish electorate whose unity — undergirded by a demographic and cultural shift — must be reckoned with in every election, whether it’s for Congress or city council.
“The future of our community rests on the fact that you have to get out and vote, and whoever you believe in voting for that’s OK,” Mark said she told voters. “Because if we don’t create a Jewish voting bloc, no one will listen to us.”",https://forward.com/news/681436/trump-jewish-vote-orthodox-pico-robertson/,real,0
"How a Jewish neighborhood in liberal Los Angeles became a stronghold for Trump.

In the heart of liberal Los Angeles, a Jewish neighborhood that has long been a bastion of progressive values has become an unexpected stronghold for former President Donald Trump. The political shift within this community, traditionally aligned with Democratic ideals, offers a fascinating glimpse into the changing dynamics of American politics, especially within minority communities.

The Setting: A Progressive Jewish Community
Los Angeles' Fairfax district, home to a significant Jewish population, has historically been an epicenter of left-wing politics. It has long been known for its commitment to civil rights, progressive social policies, and support for Democratic candidates. The neighborhood, with its Jewish-owned businesses, synagogues, and cultural landmarks, represented the ideals of inclusivity and liberalism. However, over the past several years, a noticeable shift has occurred, turning this once-Democratic enclave into a place where Trump supporters thrive.

The Roots of the Shift
The roots of this shift can be traced back to several converging factors. For many Jews in the Fairfax district, the transition began with their growing discontent with the Democratic Party’s stance on issues relating to Israel. Under the leadership of Trump, the U.S. recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved its embassy there, a decision that was met with widespread approval by many American Jews. For those in the Fairfax neighborhood who viewed this as an affirmation of their cultural and religious ties to Israel, Trump’s actions stood in stark contrast to the increasingly vocal critiques of Israel within the left-wing factions of the Democratic Party.

A number of Jewish voters in Fairfax expressed frustration with what they saw as the left's growing association with anti-Israel rhetoric. The rise of figures like Representative Ilhan Omar, whose comments on Israel were widely condemned as antisemitic, alienated many Jewish voters who had previously identified with liberal values. Trump, who positioned himself as a strong advocate for Israel, garnered their support despite his controversial rhetoric and policies on other issues.

Economic Concerns and Trump's Populist Appeal
In addition to foreign policy, economic issues played a significant role in shifting political allegiances in the Fairfax neighborhood. Like many other working-class and middle-class communities across America, parts of the Jewish population in Fairfax had become disillusioned with the perceived economic stagnation under the Obama administration. The Trump administration’s focus on tax cuts, deregulation, and its promises to revive American industry resonated with some residents who felt left behind by the coastal elite's growing wealth.

Moreover, Trump's populist rhetoric, which often framed the political elite as out of touch with the concerns of ordinary citizens, found a receptive audience among some Jewish voters who were dissatisfied with what they saw as the disconnected political class. The rhetoric of ""America First,"" while controversial, was particularly appealing to those who felt their needs were being overshadowed by progressive causes unrelated to their immediate concerns.

A Growing Tension Between Generations
The divide in the Jewish community of Fairfax is also generational. Older Jews, many of whom had been voting Democrats for decades, are often more supportive of Trump's stance on Israel and his economic policies. Conversely, younger Jewish voters tend to lean further left, embracing social justice issues and more progressive stances on issues such as immigration, climate change, and systemic inequality.

The generational divide has been palpable, with younger Jews expressing frustration with the perceived alignment of their parents and grandparents with Trump’s policies. This tension has manifested in debates at local synagogues, community meetings, and even within families. As younger Jews in Fairfax embrace a more left-wing ideology, older voters have found themselves aligning with Trump’s vision for America, largely driven by his unwavering support for Israel and his economic policies.

The Role of Media and Social Media
Social media has played a significant role in reshaping political views, including within the Jewish community in Fairfax. Conservative voices on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have found a receptive audience among the community's more conservative members. The internet has allowed the creation of niche echo chambers where pro-Trump Jews can connect and amplify their voices, further solidifying their position within the neighborhood.

The influx of right-wing media personalities who speak directly to Jewish Americans and share content supportive of Trump’s policies has also contributed to the shift. This has created an alternative narrative that counters the predominantly liberal discourse surrounding Jewish issues in mainstream media.

The Trump Effect: A Symbol of Resistance?
For many in Fairfax, supporting Trump has become more than just a political stance—it’s a symbol of resistance against what they perceive as a growing anti-Semitic climate in liberal circles. The rise of far-left rhetoric that criticizes Israel and dismisses the concerns of Jewish communities has pushed some Jews to align with the political right as a way to protect their identity and interests.

In some ways, the support for Trump has become a rejection of what they see as the growing dominance of progressive politics in Jewish spaces, particularly within urban areas like Los Angeles. These individuals view their endorsement of Trump as a defense of traditional values, religious identity, and the preservation of a strong U.S.-Israel relationship, which they feel the left no longer champions.

Conclusion: A Microcosm of a Larger Trend
The transformation of Fairfax into a stronghold for Trump-supporting Jews in a traditionally liberal city like Los Angeles speaks to a broader realignment of political affiliations among American Jews. While most Jews in the United States remain loyal to the Democratic Party, communities like Fairfax demonstrate that the old political categories no longer hold the same sway. For some Jewish voters, Trump's populist appeal, support for Israel, and economic policies have created a compelling reason to break with tradition.

The changing dynamics in Fairfax, a neighborhood that once represented the progressive Jewish vote, offer a snapshot of the evolving political landscape in America. As political divisions continue to grow, even communities with deep roots in liberalism will find themselves grappling with new alliances and shifting loyalties in the face of changing global and domestic challenges.","Generate an article with the following title: ""How a Jewish neighborhood in liberal Los Angeles became a stronghold for Trump""",fake,1
"Study finds extreme weather can increase anxiety by up to 32 percent.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (CBS19 NEWS) -- A recent study conducted by Thriveworks, a mental health company based in Charlottesville, found that extreme weather conditions can increase anxiety by up to 32 percent.

Holly Humphreys, a licensed counselor with Thriveworks, explains why events like storms have such a strong impact on mental health and how to manage anxiety caused by them.

“A lot of it has to do with the 'what ifs,'” Humphreys explained. “The unexpectedness of it— you can try to prepare as much as possible, but you don’t know if you’ll be able to get out and do the things you need to do, or how it’s going to impact your work or childcare needs if you have kids at home.”

Humphreys also stressed the importance of distraction when anxiety sets in.

“You can plan the best that you can, but it’s going to be what it’s going to be, and you will be able to maneuver through it, you know, as it’s happening and afterwards. So just be patient and try not to control the things that you don’t have control over.”

For parents, Humphreys noted that children often mirror their parents' emotional states. If you’re anxious, they’ll probably be too, so it’s important to stay calm and teach them to manage their worries.",https://www.cbs19news.com/news/study-finds-extreme-weather-can-increase-anxiety-by-up-to-32-percent/article_bc808e84-d043-11ef-98f6-5b30d786196a.html,real,0
"Study finds extreme weather can increase anxiety by up to 32 percent.

January 11, 2025

A new study highlights the significant mental health toll extreme weather events can take, finding that individuals exposed to severe conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires, or prolonged droughts, experienced an increase in anxiety levels by up to 32%. Published in The Journal of Climate and Mental Health, the research sheds light on the growing intersection of climate change and psychological well-being.

The Study at a Glance

Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley analyzed data from over 10,000 individuals across the United States, combining mental health surveys with local weather records. The findings show that individuals living in areas recently impacted by extreme weather events reported heightened levels of stress, sleep disturbances, and generalized anxiety.

Lead author Dr. Elena Martinez explained, “Our study confirms what mental health professionals have been observing: climate change isn’t just a physical or economic issue—it’s also a profound psychological challenge.”

Why Extreme Weather Amplifies Anxiety

The study identifies several factors contributing to the rise in anxiety, including:
	•	Uncertainty and Loss: Destruction of homes and livelihoods leads to feelings of insecurity and hopelessness.
	•	Constant Media Exposure: Repeated exposure to alarming news about climate events amplifies fears and feelings of helplessness.
	•	Direct Physical Threats: Experiencing life-threatening situations, such as evacuations or property damage, can trigger acute stress reactions.
	•	Economic Strain: Financial losses from extreme weather, including repair costs and lost income, exacerbate mental health struggles.

Vulnerable Groups

The research found that certain groups are disproportionately affected, including low-income families, older adults, and individuals with preexisting mental health conditions. Younger generations, particularly those deeply engaged in climate activism, also reported higher anxiety due to fears about the future.

One survey respondent from Florida, recently impacted by Hurricane Idalia, shared, “I used to feel anxious only during storm season, but now I worry all year about how to prepare for what’s next.”

Implications for Public Health

Experts emphasize that the findings underscore an urgent need for integrating mental health resources into disaster preparedness and recovery plans.

Dr. Martinez suggests a two-pronged approach: “We need better support systems for those affected by extreme weather and more efforts to address climate anxiety as part of our broader mental health strategies.”

Coping Strategies

Mental health professionals recommend several approaches to mitigate anxiety related to extreme weather:
	•	Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: Limit media consumption and rely on trusted sources for updates.
	•	Build Community Resilience: Engage in local efforts to prepare for disasters and create support networks.
	•	Practice Mindfulness and Stress Management: Techniques such as meditation, breathing exercises, and therapy can help manage anxiety.
	•	Advocate for Climate Action: Taking action, even on a small scale, can provide a sense of agency and hope.

A Growing Concern

As extreme weather events become more frequent and severe due to climate change, the mental health impacts are expected to grow. The study’s authors call for further research and policy interventions to address the dual challenges of climate resilience and psychological well-being.

“Climate change is reshaping not only our environment but also our mental landscape,” said Dr. Martinez. “Understanding this connection is critical to fostering both individual and community resilience.”

For those struggling with climate-related anxiety, experts urge seeking professional support and remembering that no one is alone in facing these challenges.","generate a news article with title ""Study finds extreme weather can increase anxiety by up to 32 percent""",fake,1
"Kenya grapples with protests despite political unity efforts. .

Kenya continues to experience widespread protests despite renewed efforts by political leaders to promote national unity. Demonstrators took to the streets in major cities, including Nairobi, Kisumu, and Mombasa, expressing frustration over the rising cost of living, high unemployment rates, and perceived government inaction.

The protests come in the wake of a recent agreement between President William Ruto and opposition leader Raila Odinga aimed at fostering dialogue and addressing key national issues. Dubbed the ""People's Charter for Unity,"" the agreement seeks to address economic inequality, electoral reforms, and corruption. However, critics argue that the initiative has yet to yield tangible benefits for ordinary citizens.

Protesters in Nairobi chanted slogans demanding immediate government intervention to reduce the price of essential goods such as maize flour and fuel. ""We cannot afford to feed our families while politicians strike deals in boardrooms,"" said Jane Mwangi, a small-scale trader.

Security forces have been deployed to manage the demonstrations, with reports of clashes between police and protesters in some areas. Human rights organizations have called for restraint from both sides, urging the government to address citizens' grievances through inclusive dialogue.

Political analysts warn that the protests could escalate if the government does not act swiftly. ""While political unity is crucial, it must be accompanied by clear and immediate action to address the socio-economic challenges Kenyans face daily,"" said Dr. Peter Kamau, a political commentator.

Meanwhile, both President Ruto and Raila Odinga have called for calm, emphasizing their commitment to implementing reforms. In a joint statement, they urged Kenyans to remain patient and allow the ongoing dialogue process to bear fruit.

The coming weeks will likely determine whether the political unity efforts can quell public discontent or if the protests will grow into a larger movement.","Generate news on this ""Kenya grapples with protests despite political unity efforts. """,fake,1
"Kenya grapples with protests despite political unity efforts. .

Nairobi — In 2024, protests by young Kenyans sent shock waves through the country’s political scene, forcing the government to drop proposed taxes and fire several ministers. The youth movement highlighted the challenges Kenya faces as the government tries to increase revenues from citizens who are grappling with the high cost of living and are angry about corruption and what they see as attempts to stifle dissent.

As the year comes to an end, President William Ruto’s government and a large section of Kenyan youth are still at odds over the direction the country is taking. The discontent erupted in June as parliament considered a bill that would increase taxes on certain food items and other sectors in the economy to help repay foreign loans and fund development programs. Lawmakers passed the bill, leading protesters storming the parliament buildings and burning a section of it. Ruto, seeing the public anger, declined to sign the bill into law.
Nairobi has also witnessed protests against alleged police brutality. Rights groups say Kenyan security forces killed at least 65 people during protests or while in detention during 2024. On Monday, hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Nairobi to demand the release of Kenyans allegedly abducted from their homes and other places.

According to human rights groups, at least 10 young critics of the government were kidnapped by unknown men in the last few weeks. The police have denied their officers were behind the abductions.

Speaking in Homa Bay County on Friday, President Ruto said his government will end the mistreatment of youth. He called on parents to discipline their children.

""These children are blessings that are given to us. Every parent should take care of their children, let's work for our children. We, the government, will do our part, and we will end the abductions so that the Kenyan youth can live in peace,"" he said. Boniface Mwangi is a Kenyan activist. He says Kenyan youths are united against the political elite who have made life difficult for them.

""The Gen Z movement, they came together, they were united and they had one goal to reject the finance bill which succeeded and they went a set further to demand for political reforms and change of cabinet and some of it happened and that forced the political elite to come together. So for the first time you have Uhuru Kenyatta, Raila Odinga and Ruto in the same camp,” he said.

Since the protests, President Ruto has formed what he calls a broad-based government. He appointed some politicians allied with former President Uhuru Kenyatta and his 2022 election main challenger, Raila Odinga, to the office.

""We started as divided people and are closing the year with a broad-based government. We have brought many Kenyans together,"" said Ruto.

Political observers say this move is designed to better manage the opposition to his administration.

Martin Andati, a political analyst, says such political maneuvers will do little to ease the public's anger toward the Ruto administration.

""The guys in power behave like nothing happened, but the truth is that the dynamics have completely shifted,"" he said. ""The old political class, inclusive of President William Ruto, Raila Odinga, and the likes of Kalonzo, are still stuck in a time up; they are still thinking along tribal chieftains and political kingpins; they are going back to 2007 when these youths are in 2027 already.""

Political observers predict a tough political fight ahead, as the Kenyan government and political parties have to constitute a new electoral commission. The current one technically exists, but all the commissioners’ terms have expired.

Some are concerned that youthful activists will start petitions to recall members of parliament, a move that, if successful, may lead to the fall of the government and an early election before 2027.",https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-grapples-with-protests-despite-political-unity-efforts-/7918553.html,real,0
"Delays, Closures Due to Station Avenue Force Main Replacement Project.

**Delays, Closures Due to Station Avenue Force Main Replacement Project**

**Haverford Township, PA —** Commuters and residents along Station Avenue are bracing for significant delays and road closures as work begins on the long-anticipated Force Main Replacement Project. Officials from Haverford Township announced that the infrastructure improvement initiative, aimed at replacing aging sewer lines, will require phased closures and detours over the coming months.

### **Major Infrastructure Upgrades Underway**

The project, which started this week, focuses on replacing the existing force main—a critical pipeline responsible for transporting wastewater to treatment facilities. The existing infrastructure, which has been in place for decades, has shown signs of deterioration, prompting urgent action from township authorities.

“This replacement is vital to preventing system failures and ensuring the reliability of wastewater services for residents,” said Township Engineer Kelly Morgan. “We understand the inconvenience caused by these disruptions, but this project is essential for maintaining public health and safety.”

### **Road Closures and Detours**

The replacement work will require full closures of Station Avenue between Ridgewood Drive and Forest Lane during active construction hours, which are scheduled from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. Local traffic will be redirected to alternate routes, and detour signs have been posted throughout the area.

Key details include:

- **Full Road Closures:** Certain sections of Station Avenue will remain inaccessible during construction hours.
- **Partial Access After Hours:** Roads may reopen to limited traffic after work hours, depending on daily progress.
- **Expected Delays:** Commuters are advised to anticipate additional travel time and consider alternate routes.

Pedestrian access will remain available but may be limited in certain areas for safety reasons.

### **Impact on Local Residents and Businesses**

The disruptions have raised concerns among local residents and business owners who rely on Station Avenue for daily activities and customer access. Some business owners expressed worry about decreased foot traffic during the project.

“We understand the community’s frustration,” Morgan said. “Our team is committed to minimizing disruption and keeping residents informed throughout the project.”

To address these concerns, township officials are working with contractors to ensure timely progress and have established a dedicated hotline for questions and complaints related to the project.

### **Project Timeline and Goals**

The Station Avenue Force Main Replacement Project is expected to be completed by late fall, weather permitting. The upgrades are designed to improve system reliability, reduce the risk of leaks, and increase capacity to accommodate future growth in the area.

“While the temporary inconvenience is unavoidable, the long-term benefits will serve the community for decades to come,” Morgan added.

### **Staying Informed**

To keep the public informed, the township has launched an online project portal, providing regular updates on construction progress, road closures, and anticipated completion dates. Residents are encouraged to sign up for email or text alerts to stay updated on changes that may affect their daily commutes.

For more information, visit the Haverford Township website or contact the Public Works Department directly. Township officials also encourage residents to attend an upcoming community meeting on January 20th to discuss the project and share feedback. 

While delays and closures may cause short-term challenges, officials are optimistic that the long-term improvements will enhance the quality of life for the entire community.","Write a news article for the given title: Delays, Closures Due to Station Avenue Force Main Replacement Project",fake,1

"New South Bend school board majority enacts surprise facilities plan freeze, principal move.

New South Bend School Board Majority Enacts Surprise Facilities Plan Freeze, Principal Move

January 10, 2025 – South Bend, IN

In a dramatic and unexpected move, the newly elected majority on the South Bend Community School Corporation (SBCSC) board voted late Thursday night to freeze a $150 million district-wide facilities modernization plan and ordered the reassignment of a prominent high school principal. The decisions, announced during a special board meeting, have sparked a wave of reactions from parents, educators, and community leaders.

Freezing the Facilities Plan

The facilities plan, which had been in development for over two years, aimed to address aging infrastructure across the district, improve classroom environments, and consolidate under-enrolled schools. The freeze effectively halts all ongoing construction and renovation projects while the board conducts a “comprehensive review.”

Board President Sarah Martinez, who assumed leadership following the November elections, argued the freeze was necessary to reassess priorities and ensure fiscal responsibility.

“We owe it to taxpayers and our students to make sure every dollar is being spent wisely,” Martinez said. “This pause allows us to take a step back and evaluate whether this plan truly serves the best interests of our district.”

However, opponents of the decision, including Superintendent Dr. Michael Reynolds, warned that halting the plan could have serious consequences.

“This decision disrupts years of work, delays critical improvements, and puts state funding at risk,” Reynolds said. “Our students and teachers deserve safe, modern learning spaces, and this delay sends the wrong message about our commitment to their futures.”

Principal Reassignment

In another surprise move, the board voted to reassign Dr. Angela Thompson, the principal of South Bend High School, to a district administrative role. Thompson, widely regarded as a transformative leader, had overseen significant improvements in graduation rates and academic performance at the school.

The board did not provide a detailed explanation for the reassignment, citing personnel confidentiality, but Martinez described the move as part of a broader effort to “realign leadership to better serve the district’s needs.”

Supporters of Dr. Thompson, including dozens of parents and teachers who attended the meeting, expressed outrage over the decision.

“Dr. Thompson has been a beacon of hope for our school,” said Maria Lopez, a parent of two South Bend High students. “This feels like a political decision, not one based on what’s best for our kids.”

Community Reaction

The twin decisions have ignited heated debate within the South Bend community. Critics of the new board majority accuse them of overstepping and undermining progress, while supporters praise their willingness to challenge the status quo.

“I voted for change, and I believe the board is doing what’s necessary to ensure accountability,” said John Davis, a longtime resident. “But they need to be transparent about their decisions.”

Others worry about the long-term impact on morale and trust within the district.

“This kind of upheaval is destabilizing,” said teacher and union representative Amanda Carter. “We need to focus on continuity and collaboration, not abrupt changes.”

What’s Next?

The board plans to hold a series of public forums in the coming weeks to gather community input on the facilities plan and other priorities. Meanwhile, Dr. Reynolds and district officials are working to minimize disruptions caused by the construction freeze and leadership transition.

As South Bend adjusts to its new school board dynamics, one thing is clear: the path forward will be closely watched by all stakeholders invested in the future of the city’s schools.","Please generate a news article with a title, "" New South Bend school board majority enacts surprise facilities plan freeze, principal move"".",fake,1

"Rabat: a traditional oven enjoys exceptional attendance during the New Year festivities.

Rabat, Morocco – In the heart of Rabat’s bustling medina, a small traditional oven, or “forn,” has become the center of local and tourist attention during the New Year festivities. Known for its rustic charm and delicious baked goods, the oven has witnessed an unprecedented surge in visitors this holiday season.

Nestled in a narrow alley, the oven has been a fixture in the neighborhood for over five decades. Its owner, Mohamed Bouzid, inherited the business from his father and has maintained the age-old baking techniques that have been passed down through generations. Using wood-fired heat and locally sourced ingredients, the oven produces an array of delicacies, including fresh khobz (Moroccan bread), msemen (flaky pancakes), and the seasonal favorite, kaab el ghazal (almond pastries).

“This year’s turnout has been incredible,” says Bouzid, his hands dusted with flour as he tends to the fire. “We’ve had people lining up since early morning, not just from Rabat but from other cities and even foreign visitors.”

The surge in attendance has been attributed to several factors. Social media has played a significant role, with posts about the oven’s authentic offerings going viral.

Locals have also made it a tradition to purchase freshly baked goods for family gatherings and festivities.

“There’s something magical about the taste of bread baked in a wood-fired oven,” shares Amal, a resident of Rabat who waited an hour to buy a dozen loaves. “It reminds me of my childhood and the simpler times.”

To accommodate the increased demand, Bouzid and his team have been working extended hours. Despite the challenges, he remains committed to preserving the traditional methods. “It’s hard work, but seeing people’s smiles when they taste our bread makes it all worthwhile,” he says.

The oven’s popularity has also brought economic benefits to the surrounding community. Nearby shops selling honey, olives, and argan oil have reported a rise in sales as visitors seek to pair their baked goods with complementary treats.

As the New Year festivities come to a close, Bouzid hopes the increased attention will inspire more people to appreciate and support traditional crafts. “These ovens are part of our heritage,” he says. “They tell the story of our culture, and it’s our responsibility to keep that story alive.”

- **Environmental Remediation**: $19.5 million will fund efforts to clean up polluted sites, improve green spaces, and address environmental health concerns.

“These investments will not only revitalize neighborhoods but also empower the people who live there,” said Lieutenant Governor Aruna Miller, who joined Moore for the announcement. “This is about creating opportunities and building a future that Marylanders can be proud of.”

### Community Impact

Leaders and residents from affected communities have expressed optimism about the initiative. Diane Carter, a lifelong resident of West Baltimore, said the announcement brought a sense of hope to her neighborhood.

“We’ve been waiting for change for decades,” Carter said. “This funding could mean safer streets, better homes, and more jobs for our community.”

Economists and urban planners have lauded the move as a significant step toward reducing disparities in economic development across Maryland. Dr. Ravi Gupta, an urban studies professor at the University of Maryland, noted that the targeted investment strategy has the potential to catalyze long-term economic growth.

“Focusing on disinvested areas is not only morally right, but it’s also economically smart,” Gupta said. “Investing in these communities can spur entrepreneurship, increase property values, and improve overall economic health.”

### Accountability and Transparency

Governor Moore emphasized that the initiative will include rigorous oversight to ensure the funds are used effectively. A task force comprising government officials, community leaders, and independent experts will monitor the progress of each project and provide regular updates to the public.

“Transparency and accountability are essential,” Moore said. “We want every Marylander to see the tangible benefits of this investment.”

### Looking Ahead

The funding announcement comes as part of the Moore administration’s broader “Maryland United” agenda, which aims to address inequality and create opportunities for all residents. The governor’s office expects the first round of projects to break ground by mid-2025, with additional phases rolling out over the next several years.

As Governor Moore concluded his remarks, he reiterated his administration’s commitment to equity and progress: “Today is just the beginning. Together, we will build a stronger, more inclusive Maryland for generations to come.”

Major changes are planned to radio across the East Midlands as a broadcaster is planning to axe regional shows. Global, the UK's largest commercial radio network, has reportedly decided to end all local and regional shows on Heart, Smooth and Capital brands in England.

Following these changes all of the output for Capital, Heart and Smooth stations in England, will be broadcast from London, according to Radio Today. The current regional breakfast shows on Smooth, plus drive shows on Capital and Heart, will end.
Many presentation and programming jobs will be lost, and regional offices/studios will close across England. There are currently around 20 radio programmes operated on a regional basis in England across the Heart, Smooth and Capital brands.
It has been reported the on-air changes will be made on February 24. Global is expected to release more information on the changes prior to this date.",https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/major-east-midlands-radio-changes-9853462,real,0
"Major East Midlands radio changes planned as regional Heart, Smooth and Capital shows to be axed.

Listeners across the East Midlands are set to experience major changes in their radio programming, as regional shows on popular stations Heart, Smooth, and Capital are slated to be discontinued. The shake-up comes as part of a nationwide restructuring by their parent company, Global, which aims to streamline operations and focus on a centralized approach to broadcasting.

The planned changes mean that regional breakfast and drive-time shows, which have been staples of local radio, will be replaced by national programming. This move is intended to bring a more unified listening experience across the UK while aligning with broader trends in the radio industry. However, it also signals the end of an era for many East Midlands listeners who have built strong connections with their local presenters and content.

Global has stated that the decision reflects the evolving preferences of audiences and the need to adapt to digital-first strategies. By centralizing programming, the company aims to invest more in high-quality national shows and digital platforms such as Global Player.

The announcement has sparked mixed reactions from listeners and industry professionals. Many fans have expressed disappointment over the loss of local voices and regional flavor that made these shows unique. Local presenters, some of whom have been a part of East Midlands households for years, are also facing an uncertain future.

Despite the changes, Global has assured audiences that regional news and travel updates will continue to be featured, ensuring some local content remains in the broadcast schedule.

The restructuring is part of a broader transformation within the radio landscape as traditional stations compete with streaming services and on-demand audio platforms. While the changes aim to future-proof operations, they also highlight the challenges of balancing national ambitions with local loyalty.

The transition is expected to take place in the coming months, marking a significant shift in the way East Midlands audiences engage with their favorite radio stations.","Please write a news for me, here is the title: Major East Midlands radio changes planned as regional Heart, Smooth and Capital shows to be axed",fake,1
"River Plate Series: Peñarol tied with Colo Colo 1-1 in Maldonado, in a heated duel.

Peñarol and Colo Colo tied 1-1 at the Domingo Burgueño stadium in Maldonado, in the framework of the Rio de la Plata Series. The match had little of a friendly, since at times there was too much strong play and clashes that bordered on bad intentions on both sides.

In the first minute, the Uruguayan champion warned with a foray by Eduardo Darias that ended in a one-on-one between Maximiliano Silvera and Brayan Cortés, well resolved by the goalkeeper. However, the play was invalidated due to offside by the mirasol striker.

The Chilean team then handled the ball better, although without depth. The closest thing to a goal chance came at 10', when Javier Correa reached a goal position in the area, but could not define due to the quick exit of Guillermo de Amores, who kept the ball.

From the 20th minute, Peñarol took control of the game, trying to open up the field with its 4-4-2 formation and taking the lead at 32'. Damián Suárez crossed from the right, Felipe Avenatti headed the ball down and Maximiliano Silvera controlled it with his chest and finished with his left foot.

The strong leg and friction were the protagonists from the beginning, but the referee Andrés Matonte let the game play and kept more than one yellow card that, in an official match, would have been claimed more forcefully.

Peñarol changed its 11 players for the second half, despite the fact that the rules of the friendly competition provided for seven, which took away rhythm and precision from Diego Aguirre's team. The black and gold team retreated and the Argentines took advantage to gain ground.

Despite being in their own half with a marked 4-1-4-1, the carboneros had some chances to increase the difference. At 62’, a high pressure between Ignacio Sosa and Pedro Milans ended with a right-footed shot that just went wide by Sosa.

Colo Colo tied the score at 70’, when Arturo Vidal capitalized on a rebound in the home area and connected with a good right-footed shot. Eight minutes later, Cristian Zavala had the second goal in a clear one-on-one with Kevin Morgan, but he shot wide.

After that, little happened. The firm leg, sometimes going beyond the limits of fairness, continued to predominate in the night with several riots. In the last of them, at 89’, the Uruguayan Alan Saldivia was sent off in the white team after a confrontation with Ignacio Sosa.

Already at the end, the public was left waiting for the penalties that normally occur in this type of summer matches when they end in a tie, but the Chileans went to the locker room before the definition.",https://www.montevideo.com.uy/Deportes/Serie-Rio-de-la-Plata-Penarol-empato-con-Colo-Colo-1-1-en-Maldonado-en-un-duelo-caliente-uc911907,real,0
"River Plate Series: Peñarol tied with Colo Colo 1-1 in Maldonado, in a heated duel.

In a clash filled with intensity and drama, Peñarol and Colo Colo battled to a 1-1 draw at the Estadio Domingo Burgueño Miguel in Maldonado. The match, part of the prestigious Rio de la Plata Series, showcased the best of South American football: skill, passion, and a fair share of controversy.

The match began at a frenetic pace, with both teams testing each other in the opening minutes. Colo Colo took the lead in the 23rd minute when Damián Pizarro capitalized on a defensive lapse from Peñarol. A sharp cross from the right flank found Pizarro unmarked in the box, and the forward calmly slotted the ball past Kevin Dawson to silence the predominantly Aurinegro crowd.

Peñarol responded aggressively, with striker Abel Hernández coming close to equalizing in the 35th minute. However, his curling shot from the edge of the box was brilliantly saved by Colo Colo’s goalkeeper, Brayan Cortés.

The second half saw Peñarol come out with renewed determination. Their persistence paid off in the 57th minute when Matías Arezo converted a penalty after a handball incident in the Colo Colo area. The referee’s decision to award the penalty was met with protests from the Chilean side, but Arezo kept his composure to level the scoreline.

Tensions boiled over as the match progressed, with hard tackles and heated exchanges between players from both sides. The referee issued a total of seven yellow cards, three for Peñarol and four for Colo Colo, reflecting the fiery nature of the encounter.

As the clock ticked down, both teams pushed for a winner. Colo Colo’s Leonardo Gil nearly restored his team’s lead in the 81st minute with a powerful free kick that rattled the crossbar. On the other end, Peñarol’s Hernández squandered a golden opportunity in stoppage time, heading the ball wide from close range.

Peñarol’s coach, Alfredo Arias, praised his team’s resilience: “We showed character to come back against a strong opponent. The fans’ support was incredible, and we’ll build on this performance.”

Meanwhile, Colo Colo’s Gustavo Quinteros lamented missed chances but expressed satisfaction with his team’s effort: “It was a tough match in a challenging atmosphere. A draw is a fair result, but we could have taken all three points.”

The draw leaves the Rio de la Plata Series wide open, with both teams eager to secure victories in their upcoming fixtures. Peñarol will face Nacional in the Uruguayan Clásico next, while Colo Colo prepares for a high-stakes encounter with River Plate.

For now, football fans can savor this thrilling chapter in the rich history of South American rivalries. The spirit of competition and the unwavering passion of the supporters ensured that the Maldonado crowd witnessed a spectacle to remember.","Please generate a newspaper article with the following title ""Rio de la Plata Series: Peñarol tied with Colo Colo 1-1 in Maldonado, in a heated duel"".

"Zoners approve plan to use Brandonville firehouse for equipment sales.

The Brandonville Zoning Board has voted unanimously to approve a proposal that will repurpose the historic Brandonville firehouse for equipment sales, a decision that has sparked both support and concern among residents.

The new use, spearheaded by local entrepreneur and former firefighter Paul Simmons, will see the firehouse, which has been largely unused for several years, transformed into a retail space for firefighting and emergency response equipment. Simmons, who operates a successful emergency services supply business, envisions the location as a community hub where both volunteer and professional fire departments can purchase specialized tools, safety gear, and other necessary equipment.

“We’re excited to breathe new life into this iconic building, all while providing much-needed resources to our first responders,” Simmons said after the zoning board’s decision. “This will also create jobs and help support local businesses that rely on emergency services.”

A Historic Space with New Purpose
The Brandonville firehouse, which dates back to the early 1900s, has long been a fixture in the community. The building, with its distinctive red brick facade and bell tower, was once the center of firefighting efforts in the region. However, with the consolidation of local fire departments and the construction of a modern station nearby, the firehouse had fallen into disuse over the last decade.

The zoning board’s approval came after several public meetings where the community voiced their opinions on the proposed change. While some residents were in favor of reviving the building and providing a unique retail space, others expressed concern about the impact on the neighborhood.

“While I understand the need for supporting local first responders, I worry about the traffic and congestion this could bring to an already busy intersection,” said Marissa Clancy, a local resident who lives just a block away from the firehouse. “This area is already seeing more development, and I’m not sure how much more the community can handle.”

Concerns and Conditions
The zoning approval was granted with several conditions aimed at mitigating potential disruptions to the surrounding area. The firehouse’s new purpose will be limited to equipment sales, and there will be restrictions on business hours to prevent late-night noise. Additionally, the building’s exterior must be preserved to maintain its historical integrity.

“We’ve worked hard to ensure that the development stays in line with the community’s vision while protecting the historic character of the building,” said Zoning Board Chair Patricia Greene. “We also recognize that there are valid concerns about traffic and noise, so we’ve included stipulations that should address those issues.”

One key condition is that the business will only be allowed to operate during regular business hours, with no late-night sales. Additionally, the firehouse’s parking lot will be redesigned to accommodate customer vehicles without affecting neighboring residential streets.

Economic Impact and Community Support
Despite concerns, many in the business community have expressed optimism about the project’s potential benefits. Local real estate agents, business owners, and community leaders have noted that the firehouse’s new purpose could provide a much-needed boost to the area.

“We’re seeing more businesses open up in Brandonville, and this is another example of how we can revitalize our town,” said Bill Dawson, a local real estate agent. “Having a destination like this, especially one tied to such a longstanding part of our history, is a great thing for the area.”

The project has also garnered support from local fire departments, who see the venture as a chance to keep essential firefighting tools and equipment accessible and affordable for smaller, volunteer-run stations.

“The ability to purchase high-quality gear locally at competitive prices is a game-changer for departments like ours,” said Fire Chief Dan Mulligan of the nearby Valley Forge Volunteer Fire Company. “This new shop will help us and others like us stay equipped and ready for the job.”

Looking Ahead
With the zoning approval now in place, Simmons is aiming to open the equipment sales store in the next few months, pending renovations and inventory setup. The community can expect a grand opening event, with demonstrations of new gear and services, as well as a celebration of the firehouse’s history.

As the firehouse embarks on this new chapter, the future of the building and the surrounding area remains an important topic of discussion among Brandonville’s residents. While some questions remain about how the change will affect the local landscape, the hope is that the firehouse will continue to serve the community—just in a different way than it did in the past.

“I’m excited to see how this will all come together,” said long-time resident Dorothy Kelly. “It’s great to see the firehouse being used again, and I think it could turn out to be a wonderful resource for everyone.”","Generate a news article using the title: ""Zoners approve plan to use Brandonville firehouse for equipment sales""",fake,1
"Zoners approve plan to use Brandonville firehouse for equipment sales.

A request to allow equipment sales and service at the former Brandonville firehouse was approved by the East Union Township Zoning Hearing Board Wednesday night.

Mar-Mel Industrial, LLC sought a special exception to allow the sale of what managing partner Daniel Danchision called small farm and construction equipment.

He said the property is being leased to another company for such activities.

“I was thrilled to have a national company with equipment that’ll really sell in our area,” he told the zoning board. “I’m very certain that it’s going to create a few excellent jobs for people in the area.”

He said the employees of the company have been stopping by and spending money at local businesses, “versus the fire company sitting there for 12 years looking like a haunted house.

Recently, deliveries to the property have caused headaches for commuters between Shenandoah and Hazleton, a concern a Brandonville neighbor echoed. The property has been used for storage for the past few years and, in the past two months, has been packed with equipment.

Danchision, who is the township roadmaster and husband of Supervisors Vice-Chair Wendy Danchision, claimed the recent truck traffic is not excessive compared to traffic from PennDOT and the water bottling plant deeper in the former Brandonville Industrial Park.

Zoning board member Rick Grabosky asked about the driveway to the property and if trucks would be parked on Route 924 at all. Danchision said that his company owns Spring Water Boulevard, the entrance to the industrial park, and that would be used.

"Armed robbery leads to charges for London man.

LONDON, ONT. — A 27-year-old London man is facing multiple charges, including armed robbery and possession of a prohibited weapon, following an incident at a local convenience store late Tuesday evening. According to the London Police Service, the suspect entered the shop on Adelaide Street North around 9:30 p.m., brandishing what appeared to be a handgun and demanding cash from the store’s clerk.

Witnesses say the suspect kept the weapon pointed at the employee while ordering a bystander to move away from the counter. After the clerk handed over an undisclosed amount of money, the suspect fled on foot. Officers arrived within minutes but were initially unable to locate the individual.

However, surveillance camera footage obtained from nearby businesses helped police identify a suspect, who was apprehended less than four hours later in the parking lot of a residential building on the city’s east side. Investigators recovered a replica handgun believed to have been used in the robbery, along with the stolen cash.

Detective Sergeant Lisa Carter confirmed that no injuries were reported during the incident, but emphasized the seriousness of the charges. “Even though it turned out to be a replica firearm, the threat felt by the victims was very real,” Carter said. “We hope this swift arrest demonstrates our commitment to public safety and holding offenders accountable.”

The suspect, whose name has not yet been released pending notification of his family, is expected to appear in court later this week. He faces charges of robbery with a weapon, uttering threats, and use of an imitation firearm to commit an indictable offense.

Anyone with additional information is asked to contact the London Police Service or Crime Stoppers anonymously.

"Winnipeg firefighter’s California vacation turns into wildfire rescue mission.

A relaxing California getaway turned into a dramatic fight for survival for Winnipeg firefighter Romeo Petit and his partner, Melissa Elias.


What started as a fun vacation quickly became a nightmare when the Eaton wildfire erupted near Pasadena, fueled by strong winds and consuming houses on its path.

Petit and Elias were out for dinner when they received an urgent call: the fire was closing in on the house where they were staying.

Racing back, they grabbed their friend Adam Stone, his two dogs, and some valuables before evacuating down the hill.

But the sight of the approaching flames and the thought of neighbours losing their houses spurred them to action.

Despite having no firefighting equipment, Petit, Elias, and Stone turned back towards the neighborhood.

Armed with only garden hoses and sand buckets, they faced a wall of fire threatening a community of over 38 homes.

“We just kept our heads down, squinted our eyes and did what we could do to save those homes,” Petit recalled.

For four grueling hours, they battled the blaze and choking smoke, with Petit even climbing onto a roof to hose down a burning house.

“The winds were like 80 to 100 miles per hour,” says Petit “Every time there was a gust, I would have to crouch down just so I don’t get thrown off.”

Petit’s quick thinking and bravery likely saved multiple homes from destruction.

“You just turn on that switch… use that experience,” Petit said. “The adrenaline kicks in… yeah, you’re scared, but you use your experience and what you learned in training.”

This Winnipeg firefighter’s California vacation may be one he never forgets, but it’s also one that highlights the selflessness of first responders.",https://globalnews.ca/news/10956963/winnipeg-firefighters-california-vacation-wildfire-rescue/,real,0
"Winnipeg firefighter’s California vacation turns into wildfire rescue mission.

WINNIPEG — What began as a relaxing getaway for one Winnipeg firefighter turned into a heroic effort to help save lives and property in Northern California. Mark Peterson, a 34-year-old lieutenant with the Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service, had traveled to the Lake Tahoe region for a week-long vacation when a fast-moving wildfire erupted in the nearby hills.

Local authorities issued evacuation orders for rural communities as the fire, fueled by dry conditions and strong winds, began encroaching on residential areas. Peterson, who has seven years of firefighting experience, wasted no time in offering his skills. “I saw the smoke from my cabin and immediately knew this was serious,” he said in a phone interview. “Even though I was there on holiday, I couldn’t just stand by.”

Peterson contacted a local fire station and volunteered to join their crews on the front lines. Officials say his assistance was invaluable, as the station was short-staffed due to multiple fires stretching resources thin across the region. “Having Mark on board was a godsend,” said Captain Eric Solano of the Cal Fire Sierra Division. “He jumped right in, helping to protect homes, coordinate evacuations, and even perform first aid when residents were caught in the smoke.”

In the span of three days, Peterson worked 12-hour shifts alongside California firefighters, digging containment lines and dousing hot spots in temperatures that soared above 38°C (100°F). Although he had dealt with grassfires on the prairies before, Peterson noted that the hilly, forested terrain added a whole new level of challenge.

Peterson’s vacation may have been cut short, but he says the unexpected detour was well worth it. “I’m just glad I could help,” he said. “We’re all in this together when it comes to fighting these devastating wildfires.”",Generate an authentic news article of around 300 words based on this news title: Winnipeg firefighter’s California vacation turns into wildfire rescue mission.

The weather service strongly advised people not to swim, surf or go boating on the water during these dangerous conditions. High surf and rip currents could capsize boats or drag people out to sea, according to forecasters.

""These conditions have a history of vessel damage and loss of life. Mariners should avoid these areas, or remain in safe harbor until conditions improve,"" the weather service said.",https://patch.com/california/palosverdes/dramatic-windstorm-prompts-ocean-hazard-warning-palos-verdes,real,0
"Dramatic Windstorm Prompts Ocean Hazard Warning In Palos Verdes.

Palos Verdes, CA — A powerful windstorm swept through the Palos Verdes Peninsula on Thursday, prompting the National Weather Service (NWS) to issue an Ocean Hazard Warning for the coastal community. The gale-force winds, which reached speeds of up to 50 miles per hour, stirred treacherous ocean conditions, raising concerns for residents and visitors alike.

Local authorities have reported large swells and dangerous rip currents along the coast, with waves cresting as high as 10 feet in some areas. The storm’s intensity, combined with a high tide, has led to the erosion of several beach areas and forced the temporary closure of popular spots like Abalone Cove and Bluff Cove.

“The combination of strong winds and heavy surf creates an extremely hazardous situation for swimmers, surfers, and boaters,” said Sarah Langston, a meteorologist with the NWS. “We’re advising everyone to stay away from the water until conditions improve.”

Emergency Response Underway

The Los Angeles County Fire Department’s Lifeguard Division has increased patrols along the coast to ensure public safety. Crews have been dispatched to monitor cliffside trails and oceanfront properties, which are particularly vulnerable to the storm’s effects.

“We’ve already conducted three rescues today, including one involving a kayaker who was swept out to sea,” said Captain Marcos Ramirez. “We’re urging everyone to heed the warnings and exercise caution.”

In addition to coastal risks, the windstorm has caused disruptions inland. Several trees were uprooted in residential neighborhoods, damaging vehicles and power lines. Southern California Edison reported power outages affecting more than 2,000 customers in the region.

Precautions and Preparations

Local officials are urging residents to secure outdoor furniture, trash bins, and other loose items that could become projectiles in high winds. Coastal homeowners are also advised to take precautions against potential flooding and erosion.

“This is a wake-up call for everyone to be prepared,” said Palos Verdes Estates Mayor Karen Taguchi. “Our community is resilient, but it’s critical to follow safety guidelines and look out for one another during extreme weather events.”

What’s Next?

The windstorm is expected to persist through the weekend, with gusts gradually diminishing by Sunday evening. However, forecasters warn that residual ocean conditions may remain hazardous for several days. The NWS will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as necessary.

For now, residents and visitors are encouraged to stay informed through local news channels and official alerts. Those in need of assistance are advised to contact the city’s emergency hotline at (310) 123-4567.

Stay Safe

With the unpredictable nature of weather systems, authorities emphasize the importance of staying vigilant. Whether it’s enjoying the stunning views of Palos Verdes or protecting loved ones from harm, safety must come first.","Create a news article that has the title ""Dramatic Windstorm Prompts Ocean Hazard Warning In Palos Verdes""",fake,1
"Passengers evacuate Delta flight on slides after aborted takeoff in snowy Atlanta.

ATLANTA — A Delta Airlines flight was forced to abort its takeoff at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Tuesday morning due to weather-related issues, leading passengers to evacuate the aircraft via emergency slides.

Flight 178, bound for New York City, had just started its taxi when heavy snow and ice, combined with mechanical issues, caused the captain to make the decision to abort the flight. As the aircraft came to a stop on the runway, flight attendants quickly initiated the emergency evacuation procedures. Passengers, including families and business travelers, exited the plane through the inflatable slides.

The frigid temperatures and snowy conditions added to the chaos, with many passengers being assisted by airport personnel as they exited the aircraft. Several people were reportedly seen slipping on the icy ground, but there were no immediate reports of serious injuries.

Delta Airlines has confirmed that the evacuation was executed smoothly, with all 132 passengers and six crew members safely exiting the plane. The airline has apologized for the inconvenience and assured passengers that their safety remains a top priority. Alternative travel arrangements are being made for those affected by the delay.

The incident is under investigation by both Delta and the FAA to determine the exact cause of the aborted takeoff.",Passengers evacuate Delta flight on slides after aborted takeoff in snowy Atlanta,fake,1
"Passengers evacuate Delta flight on slides after aborted takeoff in snowy Atlanta.

ATLANTA — A Delta Air Lines jet with more than 200 people on board was evacuated on the tarmac at the Atlanta airport Friday morning after an engine issue prompted an aborted takeoff, leaving four people injured, airline and airport officials said.

A photo from passenger Curtis James showed slides deployed as people walked away from the Boeing 757 on the tarmac of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on an unusual snowy morning.

""On takeoff, something went wrong and engine caught fire,"" James told CNN. ""Had to emergency evacuate the plane.""

Atlanta Bound: Notre Dame Beats Penn State 27-24 in Orange Bowl

January 10, 2025 – Miami Gardens, FL

In a thrilling showdown under the lights of Hard Rock Stadium, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish edged the Penn State Nittany Lions 27-24 in a nail-biting Orange Bowl matchup. The victory secured Notre Dame’s place in the College Football Playoff National Championship game, where they will head to Atlanta for their shot at glory.

A Game for the Ages

The game lived up to its billing as a clash of titans, with both teams leaving everything on the field. Notre Dame quarterback Sam Hartman orchestrated a masterful final drive late in the fourth quarter, setting up kicker Blake Grupe for a game-winning 43-yard field goal with just five seconds remaining.

“This was about heart and determination,” said Hartman, who finished the game with 325 passing yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions. “We knew it was going to take all four quarters, and we showed we’re built for this moment.”

Penn State’s dynamic offense, led by quarterback Drew Allar, made life difficult for the Notre Dame defense. Allar threw for 280 yards and three touchdowns, including a stunning 55-yard strike to KeAndre Lambert-Smith that tied the game at 24 with just over two minutes to play.

However, Notre Dame’s defense stepped up when it mattered most, forcing Penn State to settle for short possessions in the second half and giving their offense the chance to clinch the win.

Momentum Swings and Key Plays

The game was defined by momentum swings and high-stakes moments. Notre Dame opened the scoring with a 15-yard touchdown pass from Hartman to tight end Mitchell Evans, but Penn State answered with two quick touchdowns, taking a 14-7 lead in the second quarter.

The Irish pulled even before halftime on a 10-yard rushing touchdown by Audric Estimé, who led all rushers with 112 yards on 18 carries.

A critical turning point came early in the fourth quarter when Notre Dame’s defense stopped Penn State on a fourth-and-2 at midfield. That stop set up a 12-play, 58-yard drive capped by a 9-yard touchdown catch by wide receiver Jayden Thomas to give Notre Dame a 24-17 lead.

Heading to Atlanta

For Notre Dame, the win marked their first Orange Bowl victory since 1990 and their first trip to the national championship game in over a decade. Head coach Marcus Freeman praised his team’s resilience in the postgame press conference.

“These guys never quit. They trust each other, they trust the process, and tonight, it all paid off,” Freeman said. “We’re excited to head to Atlanta and compete for a national title.”

Penn State, meanwhile, ends their season with an 11-2 record, falling just short of their championship aspirations. Head coach James Franklin expressed pride in his team but lamented the missed opportunities.

“Our guys fought hard, and I’m proud of the effort,” Franklin said. “But in games like this, it comes down to execution in key moments, and we fell short tonight.”

Looking Ahead

Notre Dame will now prepare to face the winner of the Rose Bowl, where Michigan takes on Alabama. The championship game is set for January 15 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, promising another epic showdown in college football’s biggest stage.

For the Fighting Irish faithful, the dream of a national title is alive and well, and all eyes are now on Atlanta.","Please generate a news article with a title, "" Atlanta Bound: Notre Dame beats Penn State 27-24 in Orange Bowl"".",fake,1

"Group wants more attention for Williamsburg’s Civil War battlefield.

Volunteers of a little-known group called the Williamsburg Battlefield Association have come together in an effort to tell forgotten stories of the citizens, soldiers and enslaved people of the Civil War in Williamsburg.

The group also wants to unify efforts to save and preserve core elements of Williamsburg’s battleground land.

Currently, there are four parcels encompassed by the old battlefield that are under the auspices of the American Battlefield Trust. It is the responsibility of the local battlefield association to be stewards or custodians of that property and to seek other opportunities for the enlargement of battlefield land.

The association hopes “to enhance their visibility of the sites to the public via tours and other educational functions,” explained Marty Blank, one of the board members.

The small organization began about a decade ago with 12 board members, with an additional 30 members in recent years. The group now wants to let area residents “know of our existence as we begin to initiate our operations to expand the importance of our preserved Civil War history,” he added.

Until 10 years ago, there really was no Williamsburg Battlefield, such as those at other Virginia and Maryland locations, where battles between Union and Confederate forces engaged in often hand-to-hand combat. The United Daughters of the Confederacy owns the site on Penniman Road of the original Fort Magruder, the largest of a series of defensive redoubts stretching across the Peninsula from the James to the York River.

In 2007 the city of Williamsburg also protected and developed Redoubt Park on Quarterpath Road, which encompassed redoubts 1 and 2 on the James River side of the extended battlefield.

The 14 redoubts — the Williamsburg Line — were the primary combat areas of the May 5, 1862, Battle of Williamsburg. Through the years, much of the land has been developed into residential and commercial areas.

In 2015 Anheuser-Busch donated land along Interstate 64 in York County — part of the battlefield — to the American Battlefield Trust, a Fredericksburg-based organization established in 1987 to preserve and protect Revolutionary, Civil War and War of 1812 battlefields. Its mission is to preserve “America’s hallowed battlegrounds and educate the public about what happened there and why it is matters.”

Those 65 acres began an effort to save Williamsburg Battlefield land, which now includes three other acquisitions amounting to 342.5 acres that the local association helped secure through related efforts. The Battlefield Trust, through grants and gifts, paid more than $13 million for the total land.

There are many small, exciting stories about the Williamsburg battle, but in retrospect the major elements are the fighting and the story of enslaved people aiding the Union Army.

The battle itself included about 54,000 Union and Confederate troops, resulting in nearly 4,000 casualties, dead and wounded. Historian Glenn Brasher said the actions of the enslaved at the Williamsburg battle demonstrate efforts “African Americans played even before the Emancipation Proclamation in saving the union and freeing their people from bondage.”

A group of enslaved people went to Union headquarters with the information that one of the redoubts was not defended by any Confederate troops. This resulted in a major strategic turn in favor of the Union.

This redoubt was located on the 1860 James Curtis Farm, known more recently as the Egger tract. Those 245 acres were purchased by the Battlefield Trust in 2021 for $ 9.4 million. The trust also purchased a 29-acre parcel from The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation for about $2.7 million.

“It is our local intent,” Bank said, “to increase the visibility of all elements of the Williamsburg battle as part of our local history that has been overshadowed by Williamsburg and its colonial life and Yorktown by its Revolutionary War story.”

“In many ways we’re looking to introduce people to the Williamsburg battle,” he added.

For example, at the Fort Magruder Inn on U.S. 60 east, one of the redoubts is located within the hotel’s courtyard. There were three signs there, explaining the redoubt. Bank said the Williamsburg Battlefield Association has designed three new signs to be placed there, giving a more detailed explanation and scope of the battlefield.

Also, at the entryway into the Egger tract, a new gate has been installed with security cameras that the association will monitor. “We encourage people to visit that site, but don’t want vehicular traffic,” Bank said. “We’re working hand in hand with the American Battlefield Trust” to protect the sites.

Ultimately, both the trust and association want to encourage Civil War buffs to visit Williamsburg and see the Civil War sites. It is hoped that a visitor center could be one day created to better explain the much-overlooked Williamsburg Civil War story.

"Group wants more attention for Williamsburg’s Civil War battlefield.

Williamsburg, Virginia, known for its colonial heritage, is also home to a lesser-known Civil War battlefield. Local historians and preservationists are urging the public and authorities to acknowledge and protect the site of the Battle of Williamsburg, fought on May 5, 1862, during the Peninsula Campaign.

An Overlooked Landmark of the Civil War

The Battle of Williamsburg marked a pivotal moment in the Civil War, with Union and Confederate forces clashing in a struggle that would shape the course of the Peninsula Campaign. Despite its historical significance, the site has been overshadowed by other, more prominent Civil War locations. The advocacy group ""Preserve Williamsburg’s Past"" is working to change that.

""This battlefield is a vital piece of American history,"" said Mary Jenkins, the group’s leader. ""It’s not just Williamsburg’s story—it’s part of the nation’s collective memory.""

"Seoul Forest Insect and Botanical Garden gets a makeover after 20 years... featuring papaya trees and stag beetles..

Seoul, South Korea - After two decades of delighting visitors with its diverse flora and fauna, the Seoul Forest Insect and Botanical Garden has undergone a significant renovation. The revamped garden, which reopened to the public last week, boasts a range of exciting new additions, including exotic papaya trees and a dedicated habitat for stag beetles.

The refurbishment project, which began in late 2024, focused on modernizing the garden's facilities and expanding its collection.  A new tropical greenhouse now houses a variety of fruit trees, including papaya, mango, and banana, offering visitors a glimpse of exotic ecosystems.

""We wanted to create a more immersive and educational experience,"" says Park Jin-woo, the garden's director. ""The addition of these tropical species allows visitors to learn about the biodiversity of different climates.""

Children, in particular, are captivated by the new stag beetle habitat. This dedicated enclosure allows for close observation of these fascinating creatures throughout their life cycle, from larvae to adult.  Interactive displays provide information about their behavior and role in the ecosystem.

""My son is obsessed with insects,"" says Lee Soo-young, a local resident visiting the garden with her family. ""He could have stayed in the stag beetle zone all day! It's wonderful that the garden offers such engaging exhibits for children.""

Beyond the new additions, the renovation also included upgrades to existing facilities.  The butterfly garden has been expanded, with new species introduced and improved landscaping. Walking paths have been repaved, and new seating areas provide comfortable spots for relaxation.

With its fresh look and exciting new features, the Seoul Forest Insect and Botanical Garden is poised to remain a popular destination for nature lovers and families for years to come.","Write me a news article titled ""Seoul Forest Insect and Botanical Garden gets a makeover after 20 years... featuring papaya trees and stag beetles.""",fake,1
"Seoul Forest Insect and Botanical Garden gets a makeover after 20 years... featuring papaya trees and stag beetles..

The Seoul Forest Insect Botanical Garden, which opened in 2005, reopened on January 7 after 20 years of maintenance. The Seoul Forest Insect Botanical Garden was created by utilizing the rapid filtration building of the Ttukdo Water Purification Plant, which was closed in 2003. It was reborn as a multipurpose greenhouse using a frame with wide column spacing. As it had been completed for a long time, the somewhat worn-out space needed improvement, and as the heating and cooling efficiency decreased, problems arose with the growing conditions, such as the plants growing up. Accordingly, the Seoul Metropolitan Government introduced a new geothermal energy system early last year, and from August to December of this year, it carried out maintenance work on the interior and exterior of the botanical garden. The entrance lobby of the Insect Botanical Garden improved the feeling of openness by improving the lighting and facilities on the ceiling, and a new wall greening system was installed to enhance the coolness of the botanical garden, allowing for a more pleasant viewing experience. In addition, plants whose stems were bent by touching the greenhouse ceiling or not growing well were organized to improve the growing environment, and lemon trees and tea trees were placed to enhance the refreshing atmosphere. The stuffy iron door at the entrance to the greenhouse was also replaced with a glass door to increase openness. For safety, the greenhouse floor pavement, the old wooden borders of the flower beds, and the wooden deck stairs were also replaced, and the interior of the botanical garden was cleaned, the pond was maintained, and pest control was carried out. The two-story, 1,800㎡ insectarium is home to over 100 species of tropical plants, including bananas, papayas, peacock palms, and golden tiger cacti. You can also see five species of small insects, including longicorn beetles and stag beetles, and over 30 species of creatures, including fish, such as carp, and tortoises. Next to the insectarium is the butterfly garden, where you can see the largest number of butterflies in Seoul, which is popular with children. It is open every year from May to October, when butterflies are active, and food plants for butterflies are grown during the winter in preparation for welcoming visitors starting in May. The insectarium is free for everyone to use. The opening hours are 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM in the winter (November to February) and 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM in the summer (March to October). It is closed on Mondays. To visit the insectarium, use the Seoul Forest parking lot or take the Suin Bundang Line Seoul Forest Station (Exit 4) and walk for about 10 minutes. It is about 500m from Seoul Forest Exit 16.",https://mediahub.seoul.go.kr/archives/2013157,real,0
"Asheville residents call on FEMA to extend housing aid for Hurricane Helene victims.

Asheville, NC — Hundreds of Asheville residents gathered this week to urge the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to extend housing assistance for victims of Hurricane Helene. The storm, which struck the region three months ago, left widespread devastation, displacing thousands of families and destroying homes across Western North Carolina.

In a press conference held at City Hall, community leaders and affected residents voiced concerns that FEMA’s impending deadline for temporary housing aid could leave many without a place to stay. The program, which provides financial support for hotel stays and rental assistance, is set to expire at the end of the month.

“We’re still in the early stages of recovery,” said Maria Thompson, a resident of the River Arts District, which was heavily impacted by floodwaters. “Many of us are living paycheck to paycheck. Without FEMA’s help, we have no idea where we’ll go.”

Local officials have echoed residents’ concerns. Mayor Esther Manley called on FEMA to extend the assistance period, citing delays in rebuilding efforts and ongoing challenges with affordable housing in Asheville.

“Hurricane Helene exacerbated an already strained housing market,” Manley said. “Families are facing insurmountable obstacles trying to secure permanent housing. Extending FEMA aid is not just necessary—it’s a moral imperative.”

Recovery Efforts Stalled

While some progress has been made in the recovery effort, many residents have struggled to navigate the complexities of federal aid programs. Supply chain disruptions and labor shortages have also delayed home repairs, leaving many homes uninhabitable.

Bethany Reed, a single mother of two, said she applied for housing repairs through FEMA but has yet to see significant progress. “We’re stuck in limbo,” she said. “I can’t rebuild my life when my kids and I are living out of a motel.”

Nonprofit organizations and volunteer groups have stepped in to fill some gaps, but the scale of the disaster has overwhelmed local resources. The Asheville Housing Network estimates that over 1,200 households remain in need of assistance.

Calls for Federal Action

Advocates are urging FEMA to extend the temporary housing program for at least another six months to allow displaced families time to transition into stable living situations. A petition circulating online has garnered over 10,000 signatures in less than a week.

“This is a crisis that won’t be solved overnight,” said Clara Johnson, director of the Mountain Resilience Coalition. “Extending FEMA aid gives families a fighting chance to recover.”

In a statement, FEMA acknowledged the challenges faced by Hurricane Helene survivors but did not confirm whether an extension is under consideration. “We remain committed to supporting disaster-impacted communities,” the agency said.

As the deadline looms, residents and advocates say they’ll continue to push for action. “This isn’t just about numbers or deadlines,” Thompson said. “This is about people—families who deserve a chance to rebuild their lives.”

For now, the fate of many Asheville residents hangs in the balance, as the community waits for FEMA’s decision.",Generate a news article for me with the title: Asheville residents call on FEMA to extend housing aid for Hurricane Helene victims,fake,1
"Asheville residents call on FEMA to extend housing aid for Hurricane Helene victims.

ASHEVILLE, N.C. -- On Wednesday, Jan. 8, people gathered at Pack Square in downtown Asheville to demand Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) extend temporary housing assistance for victims of Helene.

FEMA's Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) program, which offers free hotel rooms, originally ended Jan. 12 unless FEMA grants an individual extension. It has since been extended to Jan. 14.

Maryjo Tucker said she was displaced by the storm and has been waiting for the inspection from FEMA for quite some time now.

""I'm still waiting on the inspection through FEMA and I called them yesterday as a matter of fact and she said, 'Yes, you have an inspection due, don't know whether they're going to contact you. However, you need to be out by Saturday,'"" said Tucker. ""Come this Saturday, I'm going to use my paycheck Friday and I've already been in contact with the animal shelter to take my dog because I'm not going to put my dog out here in these streets, you know. I don't even know what's going to happen in two days, not to be able to sleep in a bed or be warm at night, you know.""

According to FEMA, if a household has a pending inspection, they are still eligible for Transitional Sheltering Assistance.

See FEMA's full statement below:

""Our inspectors have returned nearly 91,500 inspections and are about 98 percent complete with current inspection requests. At this time, it is taking between 4-5 days to fulfill an inspection request. One of the reasons TSA was extended for everyone in hotels through the holidays was to allow for additional time for inspections to be completed. (The holiday extension) also provided additional time to continue and finish repairs and/or for families to find longer-term housing. Cumulatively nearly 13,000 households in NC have checked into hotels through the TSA program. That means about 7,000 households have already checked out and been able to return home or found alternate, longer-term housing.""

FEMA officials said notifications began on Jan. 3 to individuals checked into hotel rooms who were no longer eligible for the program due to the following reasons:

1. An inspection indicated their home is now habitable.
2. They declined an inspection.
3. (FEMA officials) have been unable to contact the applicant to update their housing needs, despite multiple attempts.

Officials said that as of Jan. 6, more than 5,600 households were staying in hotel or motel rooms paid for by FEMA, and approximately 2,100 families meet the requirements for the program and are allowed to stay in hotels provided by the agency. However, it said nearly 3,500 households do not meet eligibility due to the reasons identified above.

Additional Background

Through the Transitional Sheltering Assistance program, FEMA pays directly to participating hotels and motels to cover the cost of the room, taxes and non-refundable pet fees to provide short-term accommodations.

FEMA confirms continued eligibility on an individual basis. When eligibility ends, FEMA notifies survivors approximately seven days prior to their checkout date.

Survivors need to keep in touch with FEMA, provide regular updates on housing their status and update contact information so their recovery process is not delayed.

Survivors who have questions regarding ineligibility should call the helpline at 1-800-621-3362 or visit a Disaster Recovery Center to speak with a specialist in person.

Click here to find a center with the DRC Locator or a list of centers in North Carolina.
Eligibility for TSA:
* 		Keep in touch with FEMA by keeping your contact information updated.
* 		Are eligible for FEMA housing assistance.
* 		An inspection finds a home is unsafe to occupy.
* 		Have not received rental assistance from FEMA.
* 		Don't have insurance that provides coverage for living expenses from the disaster.
* 		Did not withdraw your FEMA application.
* 		Comply with the program's terms and conditions.

"Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis can continue High Court libel claim over 'smear campaign'.

Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis can continue a libel claim against a Greek football rival at the High Court, a judge has ruled. Mr Marinakis, who also owns Greek side Olympiacos, sued Irini Karipidis, the owner of Super League rivals Aris, over several “false” allegations including that he had conducted match-fixing and was involved in a high-profile drug trafficking case in Greece, which he denies.

Barristers for the shipping magnate told a hearing in October that the £2.1 million claim should be allowed to continue in an English court, and that the allegations amounted to a “smear campaign”. Lawyers for Ms Karipidis said that an English court “is not clearly the most appropriate place” for the claim, which “lacks merit”.
In a judgment on Friday (January 10), Richard Spearman KC, sitting as a deputy High Court judge, said: “Leaving aside altogether that this is ultimately an issue for trial on the evidence that will by then be available, the gravity of the allegations complained of and the nature and extent of each publication pleaded is such that, in my judgment, on the materials at present before the court, an inference of ‘serious harm’ appears hard to resist.”

He continued: “If the claimant’s pleaded case succeeds, the level of general damages to which he would, on the face of it, be entitled is such that, from the perspective of compensating for harm to his reputation alone, the claim seems well worth bringing, to say nothing of compensation for distress or the element of vindication which is typically of significance in claims for defamation.”
The previous hearing in London was told that the allegations, which Mr Marinakis denies, were made on a website, social media, and mobile billboards between November 2023 and March last year. The court was told that the website was called “nottinghamforestfire.co.uk”, with three articles published online in November 2023.

An account was also created on X, formerly Twitter, with several posts published in December 2023, and six videos uploaded to a YouTube channel. The allegations were also displayed on mobile billboards driven around Nottingham Forest’s stadium, the City Ground, on two match days.
The YouTube channel, X account and website were all later taken down. David Sherborne, for Mr Marinakis, told the court in written submissions that the “highly defamatory” allegations were “completely untrue”.

He said they included that Mr Marinakis was a “leader of a criminal organisation” and “guilty of match-fixing practices including extortion, fraud and arson”, among others. He added that an English court could hear the claim as “the methods and the objective (the defendants) devised and pursued for their campaign were all quintessentially English”.
Matthew Hodson, for Ms Karipidis, told the court that the social media campaign had “limited publication” and “fared pathetically”, and that there was no evidence of “actual harm” to Mr Marinakis’s reputation.

He continued that the dispute stemmed from an incident at a match between Olympiacos and Aris, which Ms Karipidis runs with her brother, Theodoros. It was claimed that in the 2022-23 season, Mr Marinakis approached Mr Karipidis to fix a “critical” game between the teams so that Olympiacos would win.
Mr Karipidis refused and the game ended 2-2, with Olympiacos – who had won the league in the previous three seasons – finishing the season in third place. Mr Hodson said: “During the game, Mr Marinakis became so angry that, according to Ms Karipidis, he threatened that Theodoros ‘would not leave the field alive’ if Olympiacos lost.

“At the end of the game, Mr Marinakis then told Theodoros, ‘you are finished’ and ‘I will destroy you’. Thereafter, Mr Marinakis began a campaign of intimidation and interference with the lives and businesses of Ms Karipidis and her brother.”

He continued the claim is “wholly unexplained if not as revenge for the Aris (versus) Olympiacos game” and that the damages sought were “utterly disproportionate”. A further hearing in the case is now expected to be held at a later date.",https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/nottingham-forest-owner-evangelos-marinakis-9853771,real,0

The claim centers on accusations that Marinakis, who also owns Olympiacos FC, was unfairly targeted through defamatory statements that he asserts have damaged his reputation.

The case involves allegations that surfaced in various publications, painting Marinakis in a negative light. These allegations, he claims, were not only false but part of a coordinated effort to tarnish his image. Marinakis has consistently denied the accusations, maintaining his innocence and calling for accountability from those who propagated the claims.

In a statement, representatives for Marinakis emphasized his commitment to clearing his name and exposing what he believes to be an orchestrated campaign against him. They expressed confidence in the judicial process, underscoring Marinakis’s reputation as a successful businessman and football club owner.

The High Court's decision to allow the claim to proceed is a significant step in what is expected to be a closely watched legal battle. It highlights the ongoing challenges public figures face in protecting their reputations while navigating the intense scrutiny of their professional and personal lives.

The outcome of the case could have broader implications, particularly in the realm of media accountability and the balance between free speech and defamation. Marinakis, who has played a pivotal role in Nottingham Forest’s recent resurgence, has vowed to fight the allegations vigorously.

As the case moves forward, it is likely to draw attention not only from football fans but also from legal and media circles keen to understand the implications of this high-profile dispute.","Please write a news for me, here is the title: Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis can continue High Court libel claim over 'smear campaign'",fake,1
"Facts, Not Fiction: Partisan Elections Will Benefit West Windsor.

Currently, West Windsor's elections for Mayor and Township Council do not allow candidates to display their political affiliations on the ballot.

Our goal is to provide voters with more transparent information, so that they can make highly informed decisions when selecting the local representatives who impact the quality of life and futures of West Windsor families.

Studies show that this crucial piece of information increases voters' confidence and engagement in the electoral process.

If this initiative passes, candidates for West Windsor Township Council and Mayor will first appear on the ballot to compete in a June public primary election for their self-identified political party, as is done with county, state, and national elections, before proceeding to the November general election.

Candidates who do not wish to affiliate with one of the two state-recognized political parties who hold primaries (Democratic or Republican) will file petitions as independent (""unaffiliated"") candidates and appear directly on the November general election ballot.

Through this effort, we can address the current limitations of the dated, nonpartisan system. The partisan model promotes inclusivity and strengthens the alignment of local policies with residents' values and priorities.

Support for this Public Question is a step towards a more transparent, representative, and effective local government.

Join us in supporting better representation of West Windsor's diverse and growing population, and in ensuring that our governing body reflects our community's political makeup.

BASIC FACTS

Partisan elections allow independent (""unaffiliated"") candidates to run for elected office.
Local municipal candidates have the freedom to affiliate with any party, just as candidates running for county, state, and federal races do.
Changing to a partisan election process will not change the Township's form of government.
Candidates who wish to be affiliated with a political party first run in their respective party's primary. These elections are decided by voters in their party, just like at the county, state, and national levels. New Jersey's primaries are held on the first Tuesday of June: They are a public, open process. This starkly contrasts with the current system, with backroom decisions of a few, no accountability or vetting, and which hinders time for voters to properly scrutinize those candidates who want to run.
All candidates have an equal opportunity to win.
Partisan elections allow candidates to run as a slate, and voters can select individual candidates within a slate that they want to choose. Mixed-ticket slates may also run together independently.
Partisan elections do not dictate ballot placement.
This change will not cost taxpayers more than the current nonpartisan system does, since West Windsor already participates in partisan elections each year for county, state, and federal offices.
Most towns in Mercer County (9 out of 12) and across New Jersey hold partisan municipal elections because they support more civic engagement.
Initiative Reflects Our Growing and Diverse Population

West Windsor operates under a Mayor-Council form of government, as defined by the Faulkner Act (NJ Optional Municipal Charter Law). This structure includes an executive branch, led by an elected Mayor, and a legislative branch, consisting of elected Township Council members, each functioning independently. Currently, the Mayor and five Council members are elected on a ""nonpartisan"" basis for staggered four-year terms.

Over the past 30 years, however, West Windsor's population has nearly doubled and become exponentially more diverse. It's time for this growth to be reflected in the Township's governing body and election processes.

This Public Question on the ballot answers the need for updated practices that provide accountability and oversight, given the challenges of serving a significantly larger and multifaceted constituency. A YES to the Public Question means that you support a more inclusive electoral system.

Shift From Nonpartisan to Partisan Balloting and Elections

West Windsor's municipal elections are often unclear, because voters cannot see a candidate's party affiliation on the ballot, leading to uncertainty about which candidate aligns with their values. Additionally, studies show a significant drop in voter turnout from nonpartisan elections.

Introducing a partisan ballot will eliminate confusion and provide much needed transparency. It will clarify for voters and candidates alike, both during campaign cycles and at polling booths, who represents which political party.

Just as with county, state, and federal elections, knowing a candidate's party affiliation boosts voters' confidence and helps inform their choices, ensuring a more knowledgeable and supported voting constituency.

Why Does Party Affiliation Matter?

Party affiliation significantly influences Township policies on land use, environmental protection, commercial development, public safety, social services, infrastructure, and budgeting priorities, like neighborhood improvements and the arts. This has been evident in recent decisions about eminent domain, redevelopment, zoning changes, and appointments by the Mayor and/or Council to the Planning Board, Zoning Board of Adjustment, Affordable Housing Committee, and Environmental Commission. Party affiliation also affects the Council's support for state legislation and its ability to collaborate with neighboring towns and county or state officials.",https://patch.com/new-jersey/west-windsor/facts-not-fiction-partisan-elections-will-benefit-west-windsor-nodx,real,0
"Facts, Not Fiction: Partisan Elections Will Benefit West Windsor.

WEST WINDSOR, N.J. – A growing contingent of local residents and community leaders is calling for a shift to partisan elections in West Windsor, arguing that clear political affiliations and open campaigning will bring greater transparency, accountability, and, ultimately, progress to the township.

The push follows months of heated public debate on the benefits and drawbacks of partisan politics at the municipal level. West Windsor has traditionally operated with nonpartisan contests, a system many supporters of the status quo say enables candidates to run on local issues rather than party platforms. However, advocates for the shift point to neighboring towns that already hold partisan elections, suggesting that such a system would lead to more robust voter engagement.

Arguments for Partisan Elections
Greater Transparency
Supporters of partisan elections claim that open party affiliation makes it easier for voters to understand where candidates stand on key issues. “Voters deserve clarity,” said West Windsor resident and community organizer Marion Thacker. “When candidates run under a party banner, voters know what kind of values, policies, and approaches they can expect. It cuts out any ambiguity.”

Boosted Voter Participation
Those in favor of partisan races argue that a more defined political structure could motivate residents who often skip nonpartisan elections. “A clear party label draws a stronger sense of urgency,” Thacker explained. “Most voters are already familiar with national party platforms. Bringing that recognition to local ballots will bring more voters to the polls.”

Accountability and Policy Alignment
Partisan elections, proponents suggest, better align local officeholders with regional and statewide political currents. “A local official who belongs to a well-defined party often has a network and support system to lean on,” said political analyst Dr. Louis Park. “It also means voters can hold these officials more directly accountable for how well they adhere to their stated values and policy proposals.”

Remaining Questions and Concerns
Opponents of the proposal worry that partisan divisions may overshadow local, community-based issues. Town Council member Jerry Liu, who supports nonpartisan elections, argues that West Windsor should remain focused on issues like property taxes, school funding, and infrastructure repairs—topics that don’t fit neatly into national party lines. “Our priority must be our local community,” Liu said. “We don’t want the toxicity of national politics trickling into our township.”

Others fear that local candidates might feel pressured to conform to broader party ideals at the expense of their own convictions. “When local governance is overshadowed by national parties, people might vote along strict party lines instead of choosing the best candidate for West Windsor,” said local nonprofit director Elena Sosa.

Next Steps
The question of whether to switch to partisan elections may land on the November ballot if a citizen-led petition garners enough signatures. If so, residents will have an opportunity to cast a vote on whether West Windsor’s electoral process should remain nonpartisan or adopt a new, more overtly political structure.

In the meantime, both sides agree that continued dialogue will be crucial. “We have more in common than we do differences,” said Sosa. “At the end of the day, we all want West Windsor to thrive. The real debate is about how best to get there.”

As residents gather facts and prepare to voice their opinions, many in the township remain enthusiastic about the prospect of shaping West Windsor’s electoral future. The debate, they say, is a sign of a healthy democracy at work—one where civic engagement is high, and decisions are made by the people for the people.","Create a news article based off of the following headline: ""Facts, Not Fiction: Partisan Elections Will Benefit West Windsor""",fake,1
"Culmination of my life's work': Pitt names Jerry Dickinson as new law school dean.

In a move celebrated by many, the University of Pittsburgh has appointed Professor Jerry Dickinson as the new dean of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. Dickinson, a renowned scholar of constitutional law and legal theory, brings a wealth of experience and a distinguished academic career to this prestigious role.   

""This is truly the culmination of my life's work,"" said Dickinson, expressing his deep honor and excitement. ""I am incredibly grateful to the University for this opportunity to lead one of the nation's finest law schools.""

Dickinson's academic credentials are impeccable. He is a leading voice in constitutional law, with a particular focus on issues of economic inequality, racial justice, and the role of the state in a just society. His scholarship has been widely published in leading law journals, and he is a frequent contributor to public discourse on legal and political issues.   

Beyond his scholarly contributions, Dickinson is a dedicated teacher and mentor. He has inspired countless students throughout his career, guiding them to become thoughtful and engaged legal professionals. His commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive learning environment is widely recognized.   

""Professor Dickinson is a scholar of the highest caliber, a gifted teacher, and a dedicated leader,"" said Chancellor Patrick Gallagher. ""His vision for the law school aligns perfectly with the University's commitment to excellence in teaching, research, and public service.""

Dickinson succeeds [Name of previous dean], who served as dean for [Number] years. He will assume his new role on [Start date].

The appointment of Jerry Dickinson as dean of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law is met with enthusiasm from faculty, students, and alumni. His leadership is expected to usher in a new era of excellence and innovation for the law school.

Note: This is a template, and you'll need to fill in the specific details, such as the name of the previous dean, the number of years they served, and the start date for Dickinson's tenure. You may also want to include quotes from other key figures within the University community, such as faculty members or student representatives.

"Culmination of my life's work': Pitt names Jerry Dickinson as new law school dean.

When Jerry Dickinson’s mother died in the fall of 2023, he was approached at the service by an older man who introduced himself as George Pettrone, Pitt Law, 1976.

“Vice Dean Dickinson, it’s a pleasure to meet you again,” the man said. “I haven’t seen you for 33 years.”

Dickinson, now 38, did not recognize him.

“The last time I saw you was in orphan’s court in Downtown Pittsburgh in a hallway,” Pettrone told him. “You were walking away in the arms of your adoptive mother.”

Pettrone was the attorney who represented 3-year-old Jerry at his hearing.

“I wanted to come and pay my respects to your mom,” Pettrone told him.

The attorney, since retired, had followed Dickinson’s career — from working at Reed Smith, to founding the Housing Rights Project, to teaching at Pitt, to running for Congress in 2020 and 2022.

Given the boy’s early childhood trauma before his adoption, Pettrone told Dickinson that day, he didn’t expect what he found.

“It’s an improbable journey that you’re even here.”

Dickinson recounted that story last summer during a presentation as he sought to become Pitt Law’s dean.

“I owe this institution a lot. It’s not because of me and the prestige,” he said of wanting to become the head of the law school. “It’s because I love this institution, and I want to make it better.”

On Thursday, the University of Pittsburgh School of Law announced Dickinson as its next dean, making him the youngest person in the country to run a law school.

“To lead Pitt Law at this pivotal moment feels like the culmination of my life’s work,” he said.

Dickinson, who lives in Regent Square, joined the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh in 2017. He attended undergraduate school at the College of the Holy Cross, where he played Division I soccer, and went to law school at Fordham University.

‘He is a leader’

Dickinson was a Fulbright Scholar in South Africa, working with squatters facing eviction in Johannesburg. There, he earned a master’s degree in the law.

After law school, Dickinson worked at Reed Smith LLP and later served as a law clerk for former Chief Judge Theodore A. McKee of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

At Reed Smith, he founded the Housing Rights Project, an initiative providing free legal representation for indigent tenants in eviction proceedings in Allegheny County.

It is a field Dickinson is still active in, including winning a case last fall for a young Black woman facing eviction and homelessness.

“Ensuring equal access to resources and opportunities is foundational to preserving democratic principles,” he said.

Jason Hazlewood, an attorney at Reed Smith, was assigned to mentor Dickinson when he joined the firm. They soon became friends.

“He is a leader from the first day you meet him,” Hazlewood said. “His success was always a matter of when, not if.”

Although Dickinson’s practice at Reed Smith was in real estate and representing corporate clients, Hazlewood said, he knew he wanted to help people in the community and ensure they got a fair shake in housing matters.

“He saw that as a problem, and he created a solution,” Hazlewood said.

Dickinson said what makes academia so satisfying is that he can teach the law, write about the law and practice it — all in ways that benefit society.

He is a nationally recognized constitutional scholar.

“I am drawn to the intersection of constitutional law and civil rights, areas where the law serves as both a shield and a sword for justice,” Dickinson said. “The Constitution’s ability to adapt to societal change while safeguarding fundamental liberties fascinates me.”

Former 3rd Circuit Judge Timothy K. Lewis served as a mentor and friend to Dickinson.

Over the summer, Lewis, who made sure to say he’s a graduate of Duquesne University’s law school, wrote a letter of support to the dean search committee.

“Jerry Dickinson embodies what James Weldon Johnson described as ’the hope that the present has brought us,’ ” Lewis wrote. “He is smart, enthusiastic, extraordinarily gifted, deeply committed and fully prepared to assume the leadership of this esteemed school of law.”

David A. Harris, who teaches criminal law at Pitt, expects Dickinson to do a tremendous job as dean.

Dickinson’s experience at the school, Harris said, gives him a leg up in the position. He already knows the faculty, who they are and what they aspire to be.

“He can get to work right away,” Harris said, and not lose months trying to get acclimated.

He called Dickinson a first-rate teacher, a terrific lawyer and a great scholar.

Political background

Dickinson is also finishing work on a book, “The Bottom-Up Constitution: The States and the Evolution of American Constitutional Law.”

Harris also noted that Dickinson excels at communicating — not only with students, but with various audiences, including faculty, alumni and the legal community.

Dickinson’s experience running for Congress will also help him, he said, giving him invaluable insights into coalition-building and mobilization around a cause and idea.

“I learned the art of diplomacy, compromise and negotiation in the political trenches,” he said. “I also learned the art of fundraising. And perhaps most importantly, I learned the everyday concerns of everyday Americans. It’s kept me grounded.”

Lewis expects all of that to pay dividends for Dickinson in his new position.

“Of course it’s important for a dean to be academically accomplished and a scholar,” Lewis said. “But beyond that, what are your values.

“Jerry’s values are focused on uplifting a community.”

Dickinson and his wife, Emily, have two daughters and a puppy. He spends his time away from work with his family, skiing at Seven Springs, coaching the girls’ soccer teams and exploring the city’s parks.",https://triblive.com/news/education-classroom/culmination-of-my-lifes-work-pitt-names-jerry-dickinson-new-law-school-dean/,real,0

**Public Input Wanted on Keeping Chickens in Residential Areas**

**[Your City], [Date]** — Residents of [City] are being asked to weigh in on a topic that has sparked lively discussion in neighborhoods across the region: whether or not to allow backyard chickens in residential areas.

The City Council announced plans to hold a public forum next week to gather feedback from community members about a proposed ordinance that would permit homeowners to keep a limited number of hens in their yards. The proposal, brought forward by local advocates and supported by several council members, aims to promote sustainability and food security while balancing community concerns about noise, odors, and property values.

""We’re seeing more interest from residents who want to produce their own food and live more sustainably,"" said Councilmember Jamie Nguyen, who introduced the measure. ""Backyard chickens can provide fresh eggs and teach children about responsibility and agriculture. But we also want to ensure that everyone’s quality of life is protected.""

Under the draft proposal, homeowners in residential zones would be allowed up to four hens, but no roosters, which are often cited as a source of early-morning noise complaints. Coop size and placement would also be regulated, requiring proper ventilation, predator-proofing, and a minimum distance from neighboring properties. Additionally, residents would need to apply for a permit and attend a brief workshop on chicken care.

Not everyone is on board with the idea. Several residents have expressed concerns about potential health hazards and the enforcement of rules. “I’m worried about pests like rodents and the smell that might come with having chickens nearby,” said local homeowner Susan Bradley. “We need more information on how these issues will be managed before making a decision.”

Supporters of the measure point to the success of similar programs in neighboring towns, where backyard chicken ordinances have reportedly increased community engagement and had minimal negative impact. “This is about giving people the freedom to be self-sufficient,” said Mark Adams, a member of the local sustainability group “Green Living [City].” “With the right guidelines in place, I think this can work well for everyone.”

The public forum will be held on [Date], at [Location], starting at [Time]. City officials encourage all residents to attend and share their opinions. Those unable to attend in person can submit written comments through the city’s website or by mail.

The council is expected to review the feedback and vote on the ordinance in the coming months. For more information about the proposed guidelines and how to participate, visit [City’s Website URL] or contact [City Office].

"Newark Macy's Store To Close.

Macy's has announced plans to close its long-standing store in Newark, marking the end of an era for one of the city's most iconic shopping destinations. The closure is part of the retail giant's ongoing restructuring strategy to adapt to changing consumer habits and the rise of e-commerce.

The Newark store, located in the heart of the city, has been a cornerstone of the local shopping experience for decades. For many residents, it was more than just a department store—it was a destination for family outings, holiday shopping, and special events.

In a statement, Macy's cited shifting customer preferences and financial pressures as reasons for the closure. ""This decision was not made lightly,"" the statement read. ""We deeply value our Newark customers and are committed to supporting our associates and the local community during this transition.""

The store is expected to cease operations by the end of March, with clearance sales beginning immediately. Macy's has assured employees that they will receive severance packages, outplacement resources, and opportunities to transfer to nearby locations, such as the Short Hills and Jersey City stores.

Local officials expressed disappointment at the news, emphasizing the store's role in the community. ""This is a significant loss for Newark,"" said Mayor Ras Baraka. ""Macy's has been an integral part of our downtown for years. We will work to attract new businesses to fill this gap and continue revitalizing our city's economy.""

The closure reflects broader challenges in the retail industry, as department stores nationwide face declining foot traffic and increased competition from online retailers. Macy's, like many others, has been forced to streamline operations and focus on high-performing locations.

Residents have expressed mixed reactions to the news. Some lament the loss of a community staple, while others see it as a sign of Newark's evolving retail landscape. ""It's sad to see Macy's go,"" said local shopper Denise Carter. ""But I hope this opens the door for something new and exciting in our city.""

"Local holidays, cows missing, election is Dec. 10.

In a bizarre series of events, the small town of Meadowbrook is bustling with activity this week as residents prepare for upcoming local holidays, deal with the mysterious disappearance of a herd of cows, and gear up for the town council election scheduled for December 10.

Holiday Festivities in Full Swing

The town is abuzz with excitement for its annual Winter Harvest Festival, set to kick off this weekend. The festival, a cherished tradition in Meadowbrook, features parades, food stalls, and the iconic hay maze at Maple Grove Park. Mayor Susan Travers encouraged everyone to attend, saying, ""The festival is a time to come together as a community and celebrate our shared heritage.""

Local businesses are also taking part, offering holiday-themed discounts and special promotions. The Meadowbrook Bakery, famous for its cranberry scones, announced an exclusive limited-edition Winter Spice Cookie, which has already generated much anticipation.

The Case of the Missing Cows

While preparations for the festival are in full swing, the town has been gripped by a peculiar mystery. Farmer Hank Wallace reported that 12 of his prized dairy cows vanished from his barn late Tuesday night. The disappearance has left local law enforcement puzzled.

""We’ve found no signs of a break-in, and the pasture gates were still locked,"" said Sheriff Laura Higgins. ""We’re investigating all possibilities, including theft or the unlikely scenario that they wandered off.""

Residents have rallied around Farmer Wallace, forming search parties to comb through the surrounding woods and fields. ""These cows are like family,"" Wallace said. ""I just hope we can bring them back safely.""

Election Season Heats Up

Adding to the excitement, Meadowbrook’s town council election is just around the corner. Scheduled for December 10, the election has attracted significant attention as two longtime rivals, incumbent council member Tom Evans and local entrepreneur Rachel Kim, face off for a pivotal seat.

Evans has campaigned on his record of fiscal responsibility and infrastructure improvements, while Kim has focused on fostering small businesses and promoting green initiatives. ""This election is about the future of Meadowbrook,"" Kim stated during a recent debate. Evans countered, ""Experience matters, and I’ve proven I can deliver results.""

The election has spurred voter engagement, with record numbers registering to vote this year. Town Clerk Jenny Patel noted, ""It’s heartening to see so many people take an active interest in shaping our community.""

A Community United

Despite the unusual combination of events, Meadowbrook residents are embracing the chaos with a sense of humor and determination. ""Only in Meadowbrook could you have missing cows, a holiday festival, and an election all happening at once,"" joked local teacher Marcy Doyle.

As the town gears up for a memorable week, the spirit of unity and resilience remains strong. Whether it’s finding the lost cows, celebrating the season, or choosing their next leaders, Meadowbrook is proving that community truly is at the heart of everything.

"‘Am a human, not some god’: PM Modi on podcast debut with Zerodha founder Nikhil Kamath.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his first-ever podcast appearance on 'The Nikhil Kamath Podcast,' hosted by Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath, where he offered rare personal insights and emphasized his ordinary human nature despite his position of power.

During the hour-long conversation, the Prime Minister spoke candidly about his daily routine, leadership philosophy, and vision for India's future. ""I am a human being, not some god. I make mistakes, I learn from them, and I strive to improve every day,"" Modi said, addressing the perception of his larger-than-life public image.

The discussion touched upon various topics, including India's growing startup ecosystem, digital transformation, and the country's youth potential. Modi shared anecdotes from his early life and his journey from a tea seller to India's top political office, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and hard work.

Kamath, known for his success in building Zerodha into one of India's largest retail broking platforms, steered the conversation toward economic policies and entrepreneurship. The Prime Minister expressed his government's commitment to supporting young entrepreneurs and creating an enabling environment for business growth.

"‘Am a human, not some god’: PM Modi on podcast debut with Zerodha founder Nikhil Kamath.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, making his podcast debut on Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath's People by WTF series, said that mistakes happen and he too is susceptible to making them.

The Zerodha co-founder also shared his apprehension about his language skills in the beginning of the podcast, jokingly referring to his ""bad Hindi.""

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that while he is human and does make mistakes, none of his actions have a 'wrong intention'. Making his podcast debut on Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath's WTF series, PM Modi said that human beings are prone to make mistakes, but it shouldn't be at the cost of doing things with bad intentions.

""When I became the Chief Minister, I gave a speech in which I said I will not shy away from hard work and I will not do anything for myself and I am human who can make mistakes, but I will never do anything wrong with bad intentions. This is my life's mantra,"" the Prime Minister said during the podcast.

""Everyone makes mistakes, including me. After all, I am a human being, not some God,"" he added.

In a candid two-hour podcast conversation with Nikhil Kamath, the Prime Minister reflected on various aspects of his life and career. He shared insights into his childhood growing up in Gujarat, his journey in politics, and the significance of ideology and idealism in shaping his decisions. PM Modi also delved into the intricacies of policymaking and governance, discussed global conflicts, and emphasised the importance of youth participation in politics.

He emphasised the importance of idealism over ideology, saying that even though politics can't happen without ideology, idealism was very much required. The Prime Minister said that Gandhi and Savarkar had different paths, but their ideology was ""freedom"".

"Kenmore’s canceled affordable housing project draws sharp criticism.

Kenmore city officials are facing backlash after announcing the cancellation of a long-anticipated affordable housing project, leaving community members and advocacy groups frustrated and demanding answers.

The project, which was slated to include 120 affordable housing units near the city’s downtown core, was abruptly shelved due to what city leaders described as “unforeseen budget constraints and regulatory challenges.” Critics, however, allege that the city caved under pressure from local residents opposed to the development.

“This is a failure of leadership,” said Maria Castillo, a representative from Housing Now, a nonprofit focused on affordable housing advocacy. “Kenmore had an opportunity to address its growing housing crisis, and instead, they’re abandoning the families who need it most.”

The project was initially proposed in 2022 and received widespread support during its early planning stages. However, as the design moved forward, opposition emerged from nearby residents who cited concerns about traffic congestion, parking availability, and the potential impact on property values.

During a heated city council meeting on Tuesday night, several council members defended the decision to cancel the project. “We remain committed to affordable housing,” said Councilmember David Lang. “But this particular project presented financial and logistical challenges we could not overcome.”

Residents who supported the project expressed disappointment and anger. “Affordable housing isn’t just a policy issue—it’s a human issue,” said Kenmore resident Sarah Patel, who attended the meeting. “We can’t keep pushing working families further and further out of our community.”

The cancellation comes as Kenmore, like many cities in the Seattle metropolitan area, grapples with rising housing costs and increasing homelessness. According to a recent report, median rents in the area have risen by 15% over the past year, exacerbating the need for affordable housing solutions.

Critics of the cancellation have called for greater transparency in the decision-making process and are urging city officials to reconsider or pursue alternative sites for the project. Advocacy groups have also pledged to mobilize public support for future affordable housing initiatives.

For now, the land slated for the project will remain vacant, with no immediate plans for redevelopment. Meanwhile, Kenmore residents continue to debate how the city can balance growth, affordability, and community concerns.",generate a news article based on this headline: Kenmore’s canceled affordable housing project draws sharp criticism,fake,1
"Kenmore’s canceled affordable housing project draws sharp criticism.

More than a year ago, the city of Kenmore made a choice to invest in affordable housing — even setting aside land and millions of dollars to make it happen — but when constituents showed up in force to fight the project, city leaders bent to the pressure.

Now, state and local officials and affordable housing advocates are strongly denouncing Kenmore’s actions. And it could propel into law a new Washington House bill that would add state oversight to prevent cities from doing the same in the future.

City staff and nonprofit Plymouth Housing spent more than 20 months on the fully funded project that would have created 100 units of affordable housing in an area that needs hundreds more.

Leaders across the region said negative stigmas around poverty, public outcry and not-in-my-backyard attitudes cannot dictate the region’s ability to meet its affordable housing goals and decrease its homeless population as the crisis becomes deadlier than ever.

“Affordable housing is desperately needed, supported by a majority of voters and endorsed by mayors and city council members around the region, and taking steps backward like this is an embarrassing failure of leadership,” King County Executive Dow Constantine said of Kenmore on Friday. 
He called the City Council’s actions “profoundly irresponsible.”

Michele Thomas, the director of policy and advocacy for the Washington Low Income Housing Alliance, a statewide coalition that lobbies for more affordable housing, called Kenmore’s decision “particularly devastating.”

Patience Malaba, leader of the Housing Development Consortium, which represents nonprofit affordable housing providers, said the Kenmore City Council “failed residents struggling the most.”

The project was officially voted down in a special City Council meeting last week in a 5-2 vote. Kenmore Mayor Nigel Herbig, an employee of the King County Regional Homelessness Authority, was one of the votes in support of the project.

But even he voted against it earlier in the process.

In the summer of 2022, the council unanimously agreed to hire Plymouth Housing for the more than $40 million project. The permanent supportive housing provider secured at least seven different funding sources — which included $3.2 million from Kenmore.

Several constituents and council members, who were present during the project’s inception, claimed they didn’t know the site would serve people exiting homelessness. Rather, they thought the project would solely support veterans, people with disabilities and seniors who had fallen on hard times.

Plymouth often works with current or formerly homeless people who also fall into one or more of these categories.

Several previous Kenmore City Council meetings, project documents and Plymouth’s website declare the nonprofit provides housing for people exiting homelessness. When Plymouth first presented its project proposal to Kenmore’s City Council in May 2022, Karen Peterson, Plymouth’s vice president of real estate, began the presentation by saying, “For 40 years, Plymouth has ended homelessness one person at a time. We provide permanent supportive housing to people who have experienced chronic homelessness.”

Additionally, Plymouth secured more than $30 million from Washington state — that funding requires that tenants are homeless upon entry and earn below 30% of the area median income. Kenmore’s median household income was $132,191 in 2022, according to the U.S. Census.

Many constituents also worried the six-story building would be too tall and devalue Kenmore’s small and beloved downtown. Several raised concerns that the building was too close to the public library, where families take their children.

A surge of heated public pushback over the last two months — which led to a nearly nine-hour City Council meeting in mid-December — triggered Kenmore’s council to back out on a final step of approval for the project.

Kenmore resident Juliana Pooley, who supported the project, said a private Facebook group of Kenmore residents helped to stoke the fires against it. 

“I became worried that despite the inclusive design and urban planning, the project would have a scarlet letter, and residents would become stigmatized before the building even opened,” Pooley said. 

Former Kenmore City Councilmember Laurie Sperry spoke out against placing this project on the downtown lot, 6532 NE Bothell Way, in the Dec. 11 City Council meeting, which was the first major public showing of opposition to the project.

“I don’t think that there is any public benefit for this land being given to this project. There’s certainly not anything that I can see that is good about it,” Sperry said.   

Carol Castellani, who used to work for the Seattle Police Department, said during the same meeting that this building would become a drug den.

“Gangs carry guns. Gangs sell drugs. Plymouth [Housing] tenants buy drugs,” Castellani said. “This is a disaster in the making.” 

Metropolitan King County Councilmember Claudia Balducci said she knows well what it’s like to come under pressure from constituents. Before joining the council, she served as mayor of Bellevue. But Balducci said some projects require creative problem-solving to bring community members on board while still finding a way to move forward. 

“If we stopped doing something every time neighbors said, ‘Don’t do it,’ we would have no light rail. We would have no homeless shelters. We would have a lot fewer things than we have,” Balducci said.  

Plymouth — which operates permanent supportive housing for nearly 1,200 people — said it’s never come so far on a project to have it end so suddenly. 

“It’s a tragedy that some people in Kenmore will remain homeless because of this decision,” Plymouth CEO Karen Lee said. 

Officials at the King County Regional Homelessness Authority, which manages King County’s response to homelessness, said the region sorely needs permanent supportive housing to alleviate long waitlists.

Permanent supportive housing provides wraparound services to people living in apartments with 24/7 on-site staffing. While it isn’t the only form of housing used to help someone exit homelessness, experts say the permanent supportive model is a critical piece, especially for assisting people who might have serious physical or mental health needs after surviving outside for years. 

Every week, there are more than 1,000 nominations by case workers to get their homeless clients into permanent supportive housing for single adults, according to data provided by King County’s Coordinated Entry System, which manages housing requests and is run by the Homelessness Authority. 

According to the 2023 Housing Inventory Count, King County has 7,330 units of permanent supportive housing. These units remain consistently full with all vacant spots seeing immediate referrals, according to the Homelessness Authority.  

Based on state projections, Kenmore needs to build 559 units of permanent supportive housing and 1,063 housing units for people earning below 30% of the area median income in the next 20 years to meet the region’s rate of growth and fill its housing gaps.

Kenmore currently has zero units of permanent supportive housing, according to King County data.

“People often ask us how they can help solve the homelessness crisis, and the answer is that housing solves homelessness,” said Helen Howell, interim CEO of the King County Regional Homelessness Authority. “The math hasn’t changed — homelessness will continue to increase unless there are enough safe places for people to live.”

Kenmore’s Deputy Mayor Melanie O’Cain, who voted in favor of hiring Plymouth Housing to complete the affordable housing project in June 2022, said she didn’t realize it would house formerly homeless people until November of 2023.

She added, “Right now, our community wasn’t ready for that project.” 

The proposed six-story building’s location caused fear and outrage in recent council meetings. But it was originally selected by the city of Kenmore and approved by Kenmore’s City Council, including O’Cain. Three new members joined Kenmore’s City Council since then.

O’Cain said that she visited the location just recently and realized “Oh, this doesn’t make sense right now,” she said. 

Herbig and Councilmember Debra Srebnik, who worked on homelessness for King County and now works on climate policy for the Washington Department of Commerce, voted to deny the development agreement, which was a procedural step to move the project forward, in the Dec. 11 City Council meeting.

Both declined The Seattle Times’ request for comment.  

Plymouth Housing wouldn’t say how much it’s already spent on the project, but it did share that two staff members spent an estimated 900 hours on the project over the last 20 months.

Since Plymouth was awarded the project in June of 2022, Plymouth VP Peterson said the team has remained in consistent contact with the city’s staff. In turn, city staff have provided regular updates to the Kenmore City Council. By the time the council voted the project down, Kenmore city staff reported the council had been updated on the project during 20 council meetings. 

Deputy Mayor O’Cain said that she’s heard from many constituents who say they are supportive of affordable housing, want to help their poorest neighbors get inside and want to see Kenmore contribute. 

She also said if the city faces similar complaints and fears on future projects, Kenmore will have to move forward regardless of what constituents say.

“We do have a responsibility to provide housing to those in most need,” O’Cain said.

State Rep. Strom Peterson, D-Edmonds, introduced a bill last week that he hopes will eliminate a city’s ability to pull out of similar projects. He said Kenmore joins a growing list of cities that have found ways to get out of building affordable housing or shelter after he worked to pass House Bill 1220 in 2021, which was designed to limit cities’ ability to prohibit shelter or emergency housing.

If passed, this new bill would allow the state government more power to ensure that cities cannot apply prohibitive zoning ordinances to prevent the development of affordable housing.

“In the midst of this [housing] emergency, we’re seeing, I think, some really unproductive behavior out there,” Strom said.",https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/kenmores-canceled-affordable-housing-project-draws-sharp-criticism/,real,0
"Former Employee of State College Property Manager Accused of Stealing More Than $5K in Parking Pass Payments.

State College, PA – A former employee of a prominent property management company in State College is facing charges after allegedly embezzling over $5,000 in parking pass payments. The incident has left local residents and tenants of the company shocked as authorities investigate the case further.

According to a report released by the State College Police Department, the accused individual, whose name has not been disclosed, worked in an administrative capacity for the property management firm. The employee was responsible for handling parking permit payments made by tenants and visitors at multiple properties managed by the company.

Authorities claim that between June 2023 and September 2024, the employee systematically diverted funds from parking pass sales into their personal accounts. The alleged scheme came to light during a routine internal audit, which revealed discrepancies in the parking revenue records. Investigators determined that the employee had manipulated payment logs to conceal the theft.

Discovery of the Theft

The property management company, which operates several residential and commercial properties in the State College area, noticed irregularities in its parking payment records earlier this year. Company officials launched an internal review, which prompted them to contact local law enforcement when the missing funds were confirmed.

Detectives assigned to the case uncovered evidence that pointed to a pattern of misappropriation. “The suspect exploited their position of trust to redirect funds meant for company operations into their own accounts,” stated Detective Susan Hart of the State College Police Department. “This type of crime not only impacts the company’s bottom line but also erodes trust within the community.”

Legal Action and Charges

The accused now faces multiple charges, including theft by deception, forgery, and unlawful use of a computer. If convicted, they could face significant fines and potential jail time.

The property management company has also indicated that it plans to pursue civil litigation to recover the stolen funds. “We are cooperating fully with the authorities and taking all necessary steps to ensure this type of incident does not occur again,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. The firm has already implemented stricter payment verification protocols and staff training to prevent future thefts.

Impact on Tenants

The incident has raised concerns among tenants about the security of their payments and personal information. Some renters have expressed frustration over the lack of oversight that allowed the theft to go undetected for an extended period.

“I trusted them with my parking payments, and it’s disappointing to hear something like this happened,” said Jessica Lane, a tenant of one of the company’s properties. “I hope they take this as a wake-up call to improve their processes.”

Broader Implications

This case highlights the importance of robust internal controls in organizations handling significant cash or payment transactions. Financial experts recommend that businesses conduct regular audits, segregate financial responsibilities, and utilize secure payment systems to reduce the risk of internal fraud.

The investigation is ongoing, and police have urged anyone with additional information about the case to come forward. Meanwhile, the property management company assures the public that all valid parking permits remain honored, and affected tenants will be contacted individually to address their concerns.

As the case unfolds, residents are reminded to stay vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the authorities.","Generate a detailed news according to the title ""Former Employee of State College Property Manager Accused of Stealing More Than $5K in Parking Pass Payments""",fake,1
"Former Employee of State College Property Manager Accused of Stealing More Than $5K in Parking Pass Payments.

A former employee of a State College property management company is facing felony charges for allegedly stealing $5,127 in payments made by tenants for parking passes.

Stacy L. Allen, 53, of Spring Township, is accused of creating fraudulent parking passes and retaining payments intended for Continental Real Estate Management in 2023 and 2024.

Allen directed several tenants to make payments for the passes to her personal Venmo account, according to an affidavit of probable cause filed by State College police on Friday.

Continental staff became suspicious after Allen had been terminated for unrelated reasons and a tenant inquired about when she should make her next parking payment, even though the company requires full payment up front for passes.

Two other tenants who reported they made payments of $550 and $920 to Allen’s Venmo account and another who paid $1,000 in cash were issued parking passes that were not tracked or inventoried, according to the affidavit. Police obtained a search warrant for Allen’s Venmo account and allegedly discovered payments from three additional tenants ranging from $237 to $950 intended for parking passes.

When questioned by police, Allen admitted to receiving payments from residents for parking passes through her Venmo and said that she forwarded partial amounts on to Continental, according to the affidavit. She said she didn’t remember the cash payment but that she “probably did take it,” police wrote.

Allen was charged on Friday with felony counts of forgery, criminal solicitation and receiving stolen property. She was arraigned by District Judge Don Hahn, who set unsecured bail at $55,000.

"Kenmore neighbor dispute escalates to shooting, one injured.

A long-standing dispute between two neighbors in a quiet Kenmore neighborhood escalated into violence last night, leaving one person injured.

The Kenmore Police Department responded to multiple 911 calls reporting gunfire in the 6500 block of NE 185th Street at approximately 8:45 PM. Upon arrival, officers discovered a 43-year-old man with a gunshot wound to the shoulder. He was transported to EvergreenHealth Medical Center and is expected to recover.

According to witnesses, the incident began as an argument over property boundaries, a point of contention between the two neighbors for several months. The situation escalated when one neighbor, identified by police as a 52-year-old man, allegedly retrieved a firearm and discharged it during the confrontation.

“We believe this was an isolated incident stemming from an ongoing dispute,” said Detective Sergeant Claire Hensley. “There is no immediate threat to the public, and we are actively investigating the circumstances.”

The alleged shooter was taken into custody without incident and is currently being held at the King County Jail. Authorities are considering charges, including first-degree assault and reckless endangerment.

Neighbors describe the two individuals as having a contentious relationship. “They’ve been arguing for months—about fences, trees, all kinds of things,” said one resident who wished to remain anonymous. “But I never thought it would come to this.”

The Kenmore community, known for its family-friendly atmosphere, was shaken by the violence. Local officials are urging residents to seek peaceful resolutions to conflicts and to involve mediation services if necessary.

"City of Pittsburgh fails to repair hundreds of broken down, abandoned homes, costing taxpayers millions.

In a distressed neighborhood where the city of Pittsburgh owns dozens of dangerous and decrepit homes, code inspectors descended on the aging brick house with the condemned sign plastered on the porch.
The rotting roof, boarded up windows and an awning that hangs precariously in the front were enough for inspectors three years ago to declare the house a public hazard that needed immediate attention.
Inspectors gave the city 30 days to respond. But when the crews returned, they found the same crumbling facade with broken bricks tumbling onto the sidewalk.
Once again, the inspectors gave the city another 30 days to make the repairs, and once again, local officials failed to respond to the home that’s considered unfit for human habitation.

Under the law, the inspection crews could have forced the city into court to face criminal penalties, or asked a judge to impose an official order, but in this case, they did neither.
The violations were dropped even as the home continued to rot and fall into disrepair.
The two-story house in the Hill District is among hundreds owned by the city that have been hit with code violations for hazards including exposed electrical wiring, collapsed walls and shattered windows, but the city has failed to respond to the orders even as private property owners are hauled into court and punished for ignoring the same breakdowns, a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigation has found.
At the home on Webster Avenue, inspectors returned to the property 44 times after their first visit — nearly once a month — flagging the same violation again and again. But to this day, the home remains a dangerous and deteriorating eyesore in an area long plagued by blight.

In its role to protect the safety of residents, the city regularly inspects properties — including its own — to rid houses of dangers and to help clean up neighborhoods long shadowed by abandoned homes and barren lots.
Since 2020, inspectors have slapped violations on at least 1,300 homes and lots owned by Pittsburgh — more than one in every 10 properties under the city's control.
While many of the minor problems like overgrown trees were addressed, city inspectors found serious breakdowns in at least 550 properties — and in those cases, returned 30 days later to find the same  conditions.

“That is unconscionable,"" said Rick Swartz, executive director of the nonprofit housing organization Bloomfield-Garfield Corp. ""The city wants to make you believe that they are addressing the most deteriorated properties. But we're not seeing any real evidence of that.”

City failed to respond
The lack of response is a troubling reminder of the city’s failure to maintain thousands of abandoned homes and vacant lots it owns in nearly every corner of Pittsburgh.
For years, city leaders have called for the revitalization of Pittsburgh’s most troubled neighborhoods and have taken a more aggressive stance when it comes to private property owners.
In about 27,000 cases since 2020, the city filed criminal misdemeanor complaints against owners who had failed to respond to violations, including a crackdown on a California company hit with nearly two dozen criminal cases after failing to make repairs on several vacant homes in Homewood that were found to be in deplorable condition.
Under the law, fines of up to $1,000 a day can be imposed for every violation that’s not addressed.
In an email response, the city said it has been impacted over the years by a ""lack of funding and increasing inventory"" of properties under its watch and that Pittsburgh government ""is often the owner of last resort for blighted and abandoned properties."" As a result, ""the city's property inventory includes many of the structures in the worst state of repair.""
""Given these conditions, we prioritize those that pose the most urgent risks to the safety of the public"" for repair or demolition.
The city said that since 2020, 189 properties have been transferred to the Urban Redevelopment Authority, 98 to community development corporations, and 339 were sold to a private buyer.
But the lack of a consistent effort by the city to prevent the deterioration of hundreds of homes it owns and its failure to respond to violations on those properties continue to put its revitalization plans for blighted neighborhoods in jeopardy.
Consider the case of the Hill District, where the city owns 666 properties, many of them broken down homes and weedy, barren lots on the same streets.

More than one in three have been cited for code violations since 2020 after inspectors found dangers, including caved-in roofs, collapsed floors and rat infestations.
In 56 of those cases, inspectors returned to the properties and discovered the same conditions, some so bad the homes were boarded-up and condemned.
The Post-Gazette has previously reported on the city’s once failed land bank and other programs that have allowed many of its own properties to decay in areas from East Hills to Hazelwood.
But the city’s inability to respond to its own code inspection program and repair its abandoned homes not only impacts the property values around them, but allows the structures to deteriorate at levels that make it nearly impossible to get them back on the tax rolls, say housing experts.
“There’s a double standard that's being applied here,” said Mr. Swartz. “And believe me, folks in the neighborhoods understand that there is a double standard.”
At a time when property tax revenues are dropping and Pittsburgh approaches a budget crisis, the inability of the city to respond to the warnings from its own inspectors is already costing taxpayers millions of dollars.
Consider: As houses deteriorate and violations pile up, the city places the structures on a demolition list, records show. The average cost to tear down a home is about $9,000, depending on its size.
With as many as 259 homes owned by the city being condemned — meaning they are no longer livable — the cost of tearing them down could run more than $2 million.
‘Deplorable condition’
In neighborhood after neighborhood, the condition of the houses demonstrates a pattern of neglect that has defined the city’s oversight of its real estate through the years.
In Mount Oliver, the roof is missing on a brick home covered with shattered windows and choked by tangled vines — a condemned structure that has yet to be torn down.
In Southside Slopes, a boarded-up home with broken windows and exposed wires was found to be infested with rodents and in “deplorable condition” by inspectors in 2022. When a crew visited it nearly a year later, inspectors said nothing had changed.
In the Middle Hill, bricks have fallen from a home riddled with bullet holes and covered with piles of trash in the backyard.
One resident who lives in the Upper Hill said chunks from the roof of an abandoned city-owned home next door have landed in her yard, and an overgrown tree from that same property fell and destroyed her fence.
“It’s hard living next to this house,” said Stacey Jenkins-Jones, who has owned her home for 18 years. “[The city] put up a blue sign saying it's condemned. They say there’s money to try to get these houses torn down, but nothing happens.”

A Homewood resident demanded that the city pay for damage to his property when the roof of the city-owned building next door collapsed and rain poured into both buildings.
The city ended up paying nearly $100,000 to cover the damage to the home on North Homewood Avenue in 2020.
Before settling the negligence complaint, code inspectors had visited the building three times since the city acquired it in 2013 – and ordered the city three times to repair it.
Housing experts say inspectors are required to cite code violations even on their own city properties — in keeping with local law — and that in most cases, local governments are not required to pay penalties if they fail to abide by the orders. Many of the properties acquired by the city were already in grim condition, records show,
But the city is required to remove the dangers from its properties, especially where other homeowners could be harmed, and to warn the public to stay away through condemnation postings, experts say.
“This is not about affordable housing,” said Mr. Swartz. “This is about salvaging neighborhoods from a kind of wreckage that happens when everybody walks away from a given structure or house and leaves it to the adjoining owners then to cope with that wreckage.”
A study by the Urban Redevelopment Authority nearly a decade ago found that vacant properties across the city — both publicly and privately owned — were costing taxpayers $9 million a year in lost tax revenue, emergency calls and hours spent by city crews inspecting the properties.
City officials say that taking care of hundreds of homes is a costly, complicated process that takes time and must be carried out in stages because of the number of properties.
At the rate the city is moving, however, it could take decades before its real estate portfolio of 10,000 houses and lots are transferred or sold and ultimately put back on the tax rolls.
Backlog of abandoned homes
One of the key mechanisms for turning around properties is the Pittsburgh Land Bank, which was created in 2014 to acquire troubled homes and put them to productive use. But the agency has taken in just 78 properties since it was launched.
In April, the city council unanimously approved an agreement between the city, the Pittsburgh Public Schools, Allegheny County and the land bank, which promises a quicker and more efficient process for the land bank to acquire abandoned homes and lots by allowing it to utilize sheriff’s sales.

Though the land bank has historically acquired the homes through treasurer’s sales, the sheriff’s sales clear all tax liabilities and take half as long.
Even if the land bank is able to move more quickly to acquire homes, many of the properties are so badly damaged that the agency may not be able to do anything with them, housing advocates say.
“Imagine that a neighborhood of 50 homes is like a barrel of apples. If a few of those apples go into disrepair, or they become foreclosed or abandoned – whatever degree of abandonment or dilapidation we want to talk about – they become rotten apples,” said Frank Ford, senior policy adviser at the Fair Housing Center for Rights & Research in Cleveland.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in Hazelwood, where the local branch of the Carnegie Library, abandoned since 2004, is rapidly falling into disrepair and surrounded by dozens of vacant, broken down homes.
Owned by the city, the historic building has been targeted with code violations for failing to board up the facility, which has been plagued by a leaking roof, open windows, and people breaking into the 125-year-old center.
Though the city was put on alert about the breakdowns by inspectors two years ago, local officials have yet to address the problems. Just the cost of stabilizing and preventing further deterioration is estimated at $2 million.
“It’s really disheartening,” said JaQuay Carter, the president of the Greater Hazelwood Historical Society. “The years and years as it goes, it’s actually going to be less attractive to redevelopers — or not even possible to be saved. I mean, that’s my biggest fear. When I see it like this, it just makes me really sad. The city, at least as I have heard, has pretty much absolved itself of trying to do anything more.”",https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2024/12/15/pittsburgh-dilapidated-abandoned-houses-taxpayers/stories/202412150079,real,0
"City of Pittsburgh fails to repair hundreds of broken down, abandoned homes, costing taxpayers millions.

Pittsburgh's deteriorating vacant housing stock has reached a crisis point, with city officials acknowledging that more than 800 abandoned properties remain in severe disrepair despite years of complaints from residents and mounting costs to taxpayers.

An investigation reveals that the city's Department of Permits, Licenses and Inspections (PLI) has failed to adequately address the growing number of vacant structures, many of which pose immediate safety hazards to surrounding communities. The cost to taxpayers has surpassed $4.2 million in the past year alone, primarily spent on emergency demolitions and responding to collapsed structures.

""These properties are more than just eyesores – they're dangerous and they're draining our resources,"" said City Councilmember Sarah Martinez. ""Every dollar we spend on emergency responses is a dollar we could have spent on prevention or community development.""

Records show that:
- Over 60% of the identified properties have outstanding code violations dating back more than five years
- Emergency services responded to 127 incidents involving abandoned properties in 2024, including fires and structural collapses
- The average cost of demolishing a single deteriorated property has reached $42,000, more than triple the cost of basic stabilization measures

Community advocates argue that the city's reactive approach has created a costly cycle of neglect. ""We've been begging the city to implement a comprehensive vacant property strategy for years,"" said James Wilson, director of the Pittsburgh Housing Alliance. ""Instead, we watch these buildings deteriorate until they become emergency situations.""

The Mayor's office announced plans to address the crisis through a new task force, but critics argue this response comes too late for neighborhoods already struggling with the impact of abandoned properties. Meanwhile, residents continue to live alongside deteriorating structures that threaten both property values and public safety.

Local homeowner Patricia Thompson, whose house sits adjacent to two abandoned properties in Garfield, expressed frustration with the city's inaction. ""I've filed dozens of complaints over three years,"" she said. ""Now my property value has dropped by 30%, and I worry about my children's safety every day.""

City officials estimate it would cost approximately $35 million to properly address all current abandoned properties through a combination of rehabilitation and strategic demolition. However, no comprehensive funding plan has been proposed to date.","

"Valencia Floods.

Intense rainfall in eastern Spain produced deadly and destructive flash floods in the province of Valencia. On October 29, 2024, more than 300 millimeters (12 inches) of rain fell in parts of the province, reported Spain’s meteorological agency, AEMET. In the town of Chiva, nearly 500 millimeters (20 inches) fell in 8 hours.

The OLI (Operational Land Imager) on Landsat 8 captured this image (right) showing widespread flooding of urban and agricultural lands in and around the coastal city of Valencia on October 30. Sediment-laden floodwaters also filled the channel of the Turia river, which empties into the Balearic Sea (part of the Mediterranean), and the L’Albufera coastal wetlands south of the city. For comparison, the image on the left, also acquired by Landsat 8, shows the same area in late October 2022. (More recent Landsat scenes of the region were cloud-covered or otherwise unfit for an image comparison.)

The rains came from a high-altitude low-pressure weather system that became isolated from the jet stream, according to AEMET. These storm systems are known locally by the Spanish acronym DANA or more generally as cut-off lows. They occur where cold fronts encounter warm, humid air masses, such as over the Mediterranean Sea. The storms can remain relatively stationary before dissipating, amplifying their flooding potential.

News outlets reported on October 30 that around 100 people—including at least 40 in the town of Paiporta—died in the flooding, and more remained missing. Infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and rail lines sustained damage, and photos show displaced vehicles and debris filling city streets. A military emergency unit deployed more than 1,100 personnel to support rescue operations in the region.",https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153533/valencia-floods,real,0
"Valencia Floods.

Valencia, Spain—A torrential downpour has left the city of Valencia reeling, as severe floods swept through the region, causing widespread devastation and displacing thousands of residents. The unprecedented rainfall, which began late last night, has already exceeded the average monthly precipitation in just 24 hours, leaving the city’s infrastructure overwhelmed and its citizens struggling to cope.

The Extent of the Damage

Entire neighborhoods in Valencia have been submerged, with streets transformed into rivers and vehicles swept away by the strong currents. Emergency services reported that the city’s drainage systems were unable to handle the sheer volume of water, leading to severe flooding in low-lying areas. Homes, businesses, and public transportation systems have been heavily affected, with many residents forced to evacuate as floodwaters rose rapidly.

In addition to the urban devastation, rural areas surrounding Valencia have also suffered extensive damage. Agricultural fields have been inundated, raising concerns about long-term economic impacts for local farmers.

Rescue and Relief Efforts

Authorities have declared a state of emergency and mobilized rescue teams to assist those stranded by the rising waters. The Spanish military has been deployed to support local emergency services, using boats and helicopters to rescue residents trapped in their homes. Volunteers and non-governmental organizations have set up temporary shelters, providing food, water, and medical assistance to displaced families.

Valencia’s Mayor, Joan Ribó, addressed the public in a televised statement, urging residents to remain calm and follow instructions from authorities. “We are facing an extraordinary situation that requires all of us to come together. The safety of our citizens is our top priority,” Ribó said.

A Grim Outlook

Meteorologists have warned that the heavy rains may persist over the coming days, further complicating rescue and recovery efforts. The flooding has reignited debates about the region’s preparedness for extreme weather events, which have become increasingly frequent due to climate change. Experts have called for urgent investment in resilient infrastructure to mitigate the effects of such disasters in the future.

Stories of Resilience

Despite the chaos, stories of heroism and solidarity have emerged. Residents have been seen forming human chains to help others escape dangerous currents, while community groups have organized donation drives to provide essential supplies to those in need.

“We have lost everything, but at least we are alive,” said Maria López, a local resident who was rescued from her flooded home. “The support from neighbors and volunteers has been overwhelming.”

What’s Next?

As Valencia begins to assess the full extent of the damage, questions remain about how the city will recover from this disaster. Local officials have pledged to expedite relief efforts and provide financial support to affected families. However, rebuilding the city and restoring normalcy will likely take months, if not longer.

For now, the people of Valencia are bracing for what lies ahead, holding on to hope and the strength of their community to weather this unprecedented crisis.","Create a news article about a flood disaster in Valencia, Spain, the title is: ""Valencia Floods "".",fake,1
"Jewish kids take the stage for Children’s Theatre Company production of Dr. Seuss classic.

It is likely that only the most frum (Jewishly observant) amongst the American Jewish World readers have not seen at least a television version of the Dr. Seuss classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas! The message is more “peace on Earth, good will toward all” than celebrating the birth of Jesus (who isn’t even mentioned once).
As a holiday offering, the Children’s Theatre Company (CTC) has staged productions of a musical play based on the Grinch story a dozen times, but this time there’s a small Jewish connection in it.
That small connection is an 11-year-old girl: Batya Rose Green Hofkin is playing the crucial role of Cindy-Lou Who in her CTC debut. In Batya’s own words, “I tried to make a relationship with Cindy-Lou’s character because she’s so sweet and kind. She’s the person who made the Grinch change his heart.”
Who is this sweet and kind Jewish girl?
Batya Rose Green Hofkin lives in Minneapolis and attends the Heilicher Minneapolis Jewish Day School. She comes from a very Jewish and very artistic family (Rimon: The Minnesota Jewish Arts Council pops up on the résumés of numerous members of the clan). Her great-grandfather was the longtime rabbi of Beth Shalom Synagogue in Michigan; her great-great-uncle, Bernard Raskas, was a rabbi of Temple of Aaron Synagogue in St. Paul for 38 years; a paternal great-grandfather, Albert Ginsburgh, was also a rabbi who held pulpits in New England.
Batya’s grandmother Rani is well-known locally for her artistic ketubot (marriage contracts) and other artistic endeavors. Her parents, Tamar Halpern-Green and Ben Hofkin, and the whole mishpacha (family) are stalwarts of Adath Jeshurun Congregation, and so are Ben’s parents, Michael Hofkin and Ann Ginsburgh Hofkin, the noted local art photographer.
It turns out that Batya is steeped in local theater. Grandparents Rani and Joel Green took her to theaters all around town, even as a toddler, including CTC productions. Batya always knew in her heart that she wanted to be an actress.
She had taken her own steps in that direction at Heilicher, in fourth grade, where she and a small group of classmates created the music and lyrics for a class play. She also composes songs to play on her ukulele. Her musical tastes are eclectic; she has sung in the Heilicher school choir and likes pop, musical theater and indie music. But it was the CTC’s 2023 production of Alice in Wonderland that persuaded her to take more concrete steps toward the stage, and her parents agreed to enroll her in CTC’s acting and voice classes.
Those classes gave the budding actress the opportunity to stretch her artistic and personal wings. She said, “For me, I never have had a lot of people who share my interest in theater. It’s so wonderful to be in a community that is so accepting and kind and wholesome.” One of her friends from voice training is also in the production. “These are my best friends now outside of school.”
The CTC classes opened the door for Batya’s first professional role in The Grinch. A theater arts training manager heard Batya sing, and then the casting director also noted her talent; they supported her in her personal decision to audition for the role of Cindy-Lou.
“I was beyond excited,” Batya recalled. “I’d never been in a professional play before.”
For her audition, she was asked to sing Cindy-Lou’s song, “Santa for a Day.” To prepare her for the audition, the staff sent her a recording of the music and lyrics and part of the script for the Cindy-Lou part. “It was sort of stressful, but I had a lot of support,” she commented.
There are even more Jewish performers in the show’s cast: Brody Breen, a 10th grader at Eagan High School, and Liam Beck-O’Sullivan, who’s appeared on numerous local and regional stages.
Finally, there’s a quasi-Jewish connection to the musical: composer Mel Marvin. In his own words: “I am (sadly) only an honorary Jew. As complete a goy as they come. I am proud to say, though, that I was made an honorary Jew by Isaac Bashevis Singer, who loved my Yentl score and insisted I must have been Jewish in several former lives. I believe him.”

"Jewish kids take the stage for Children’s Theatre Company production of Dr. Seuss classic.

In a delightful blend of cultural diversity and classic storytelling, Jewish children from across the Twin Cities have joined forces to bring a beloved Dr. Seuss classic to life in a new, inclusive production at the Children’s Theatre Company (CTC).

The stage is set for an unforgettable experience as young Jewish actors take center stage in Horton Hears a Who!, one of Dr. Seuss's most cherished tales. The performance is not only a heartwarming showcase of talent but also a testament to the importance of inclusivity in theater, as CTC continues to spotlight stories that celebrate community and togetherness, regardless of background.

This production is particularly notable because of the unique collaboration between Jewish families and the theater. Some of the child actors, hailing from both Reform and Conservative Jewish communities in the area, are taking on the roles of the tiny Whos, the beloved characters of Seuss’s whimsical world. Their involvement reflects CTC's commitment to representation, allowing a wide range of families to experience the magic of theater through a lens of diverse traditions.

""I’m so proud to see my kids not just participate in something artistic, but also to be part of a production that emphasizes the importance of every voice in a community,” said Rachel Cohen, a mother of one of the young performers. ""In this story, Horton the elephant teaches us that no matter how small you are, you matter. And it's incredible to see Jewish kids bringing that message to life.""

The production itself has received rave reviews for its vibrant set, playful costumes, and a cast that perfectly captures the imaginative spirit of Seuss. The story centers on Horton, an elephant who discovers that the tiny residents of the Whoville are in danger of being overlooked. His journey becomes a poignant reminder that each individual is significant, no matter how small or different they might be.

Director Samantha Goldstein, who herself has Jewish roots, was enthusiastic about the diverse makeup of the cast. “When we bring children from different backgrounds together for a production like this, we’re teaching them the value of empathy and collaboration,"" she said. ""The themes of Horton and the Whos resonate deeply with Jewish values of community, tikkun olam (repairing the world), and the importance of standing up for what is right.""

The Children’s Theatre Company has long been a platform for young talent to explore complex themes, with a focus on inclusion and educational programming. With Horton Hears a Who!, the theater is once again reinforcing its mission to nurture the next generation of artists and thinkers in a way that encourages dialogue between different communities.

For many of the young Jewish performers, being a part of this production is also an opportunity to share their cultural heritage. ""My family always says, 'it’s not where you come from, but how you use your voice,'"" said 10-year-old actor Sarah Klein, who plays one of the Whos. ""I love that my Jewish faith is a part of who I am, and I think Horton’s message about helping others is something we can all connect with.”

The opening night of Horton Hears a Who! was filled with joy and pride as families and friends packed the CTC’s main theater. The show is expected to run through the end of January, with school groups and community members coming together to witness this exciting intersection of Seuss’s creativity and the rich cultural tapestry of the Twin Cities.

Tickets are available now, and the Children’s Theatre Company encourages families to bring their children for a magical experience that will leave everyone reminded of the power of kindness, inclusivity, and the importance of finding one’s voice in a world of wonder.

As Horton famously says, “A person's a person, no matter how small.” And for these young performers, their voices are indeed being heard loud and clear.","Generate a news article with the following title: ""Jewish kids take the stage for Children’s Theatre Company production of Dr. Seuss classic""",fake,1

"Full Wolf Moon Aligns With Mars, More Planetary Parades Over Fremont.

NASA reports that Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars will align in the night sky this month.

FREMONT, CA — Skygazers are in for a special celestial treat with this year’s full wolf moon on Monday night if sky conditions in Fremont cooperate. As of now, the forecast calls for clear skies.

The moon will pass directly in front of Mars, combining with the bright star Pollux to create a stunning view. Mars is one of four planets lining up this month in a rare four-planet conjunction.

Below is all you need to know about taking it all in.

Conjunction Of The Moon And Mars

The moon reaches peak illumination at 2:27 p.m. PST Monday. Once it peeks over the horizon, it’s time to start watching for the magic. Times vary by region, according to NASA, whose times are localized to the agency’s headquarters in Washington, D.C.

Just after twilight, the rising full moon will pass in front of the bright planet Mars, with the bright star Pollux above the pair.

As evening twilight ends around 6:11 p.m., the three will form a triangle, with Mars just 2 degrees to the lower left and Pollux 3 degrees to the upper left of the moon.
Mars will disappear behind the bottom of the moon at about 9:16 p.m. then reappear from behind the upper right of the moon about 9:16 p.m.
By the time the moon reaches its highest point in the sky at 12:37 a.m. Tuesday, Mars will be 1 degree to the right of Moon and Pollux will be 5 degrees to the upper right. When morning twilight begins around 6:23 a.nm., Mars will be 4 degrees and Pollux 8 degrees to the lower right of the Moon.

4-Planet Parade

Throughout January, Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars will align in the night sky, according to NASA.

Just after sunset, look southwest and find Venus and Saturn low in the sky. Jupiter shines brightly above them, and Mars glows in the eastern sky. They’re all visible to the naked eye during clear conditions, but a telescope may reveal two other planets, Uranus and Neptune.

Because the planets align along the ecliptic, the solar system’s orbital plane, they appear to seem close together from Earth, NASA explains.

Each evening in January, Venus and Saturn will appear closer together, appearing the closest on Jan. 17-18 before gradually moving apart. NASA says the rare event offers a great opportunity for skywatchers to observe planetary movement.

Why Is It Called The Wolf Moon?

January’s full moon is known as the wolf moon. Wolves seem to howl more at this time of year as the snow and cold of winter set in. According to lore, wolves howled because they were starving.

That’s not the case, though.

The truth reveals the complexity of wolves’ social lives.

“Howling is for long-distance communication to pull a pack back together and keep strangers away,” according to the National Wildlife Federation.

This communication also includes submissive behavior. A wolf not willing to challenge the hierarchy will often crouch and whimper, tuck in its tail, lick the other wolf’s mouth or roll over on its back, the organization said.

Full Wolf Moon Aligns With Mars, More Planetary Parades Over Fremont
Fremont, CA – January 10, 2025 – Stargazers in Fremont were treated to a breathtaking celestial event last night as the Full Wolf Moon aligned with Mars, creating a dazzling display in the night sky. This rare conjunction kicked off a series of planetary parades that will continue to unfold over the coming weeks, offering astronomy enthusiasts multiple opportunities for skywatching.

The Full Wolf Moon, named by Native American tribes for the hungry wolves howling in midwinter, reached peak illumination just as the Red Planet made its closest approach in months. The alignment was visible to the naked eye, with Mars appearing as a bright, reddish point of light near the glowing full moon.

A Rare and Stunning Sight
Local astronomers and space enthusiasts gathered at the Fremont Peak Observatory to witness the spectacle. “It was a fantastic alignment,” said Dr. Sarah Calloway, an astrophysicist and professor at a nearby university. “Seeing the Full Wolf Moon and Mars so close together in the sky was an awe-inspiring experience. These events remind us of the beauty and precision of our universe.”

Observers using telescopes and binoculars were able to see Mars’ distinct reddish hue even more vividly against the bright lunar glow. Some lucky stargazers even caught glimpses of surface details on Mars, such as its polar ice caps and dark maria, thanks to the planet’s proximity and favorable viewing conditions.

More Planetary Alignments to Come
This spectacular event is just the beginning of a series of planetary parades in the coming weeks. Later this month, Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus will line up in the western sky just after sunset, forming a striking trio visible to the naked eye.

Additionally, Mercury, the smallest and fastest-moving planet in our solar system, will reach its highest point in the evening sky, making it easier to spot for those with a clear view of the horizon.

“This is a fantastic time for skywatching,” said Calloway. “We have a number of celestial alignments happening in close succession, and many of them don’t require special equipment to enjoy.”

Best Ways to View the Night Sky
For those hoping to catch the upcoming planetary parades, experts recommend finding a dark location away from city lights, such as Mission Peak Regional Preserve or Coyote Hills Regional Park. The best viewing times will be shortly after sunset for the planetary alignments, while late-night observers can continue to enjoy bright lunar and stellar events.

Skywatchers are also encouraged to use mobile apps such as SkyView or Star Walk to help locate celestial objects and track upcoming events.

With more cosmic wonders on the way, Fremont’s night sky promises to be a spectacular canvas for both amateur and seasoned astronomers alike. Keep your eyes to the sky – the universe is putting on a show you won’t want to miss!","Full Wolf Moon Aligns With Mars, More Planetary Parades Over Fremont

"Toward a Green Revolution in Sub-Saharan Africa: Farm Mechanization in the Mwea Irrigation Scheme.

Governments in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have made concerted efforts to improve farmers’ adoption of modern technologies in their farm operations to realize a rice Green Revolution, improve food security, and alleviate poverty. However, smallholder farmers’ access to farm mechanization in SSA remains constrained due to supply-side and demand-side challenges. On the supply side, the market for agricultural machinery services is often underdeveloped. On the demand side, the smallholders with inadequate knowledge of improved rice cultivation practices have limited demand for mechanized services despite increasing wage rates. This study analyzes the mechanization process of rice farmers in the Mwea Irrigation Scheme, Kenya. The Mwea Irrigation Scheme is the most advanced rice production area in SSA, with farmers familiar with improved rice cultivation practices, well-functioning input credit markets, and millers adopting modern milling technologies, enabling local rice to compete with imported Asian rice. Analyzing original data collected in 2011, 2016, and 2018, we found that most farmers in Mwea implemented rotavation using tractor services provided by farmers’ cooperatives, while they implemented leveling using draft animals. Non-cooperative members reduced tractor use and adopted draft animals to implement both harrowing and leveling, implying the importance of a well-developed mechanization service market.",https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-5542-6_5,real,0
"Engelbert Dollfuß – an attempt at a fair portrait.

VIENNA, Austria – Even today, nearly a century after his tenure, Engelbert Dollfuß remains one of Austria’s most controversial historical figures. Lauded by some for his staunch opposition to Nazism yet criticized by many for his authoritarian crackdown at home, Dollfuß’s complex political record continues to evoke debate among historians and the Austrian public. This article aims to present a nuanced view of Dollfuß’s life, leadership, and legacy—an attempt at a fair portrait of a man caught in the turbulent political shifts of 1930s Europe.

Early Life and Political Rise
Engelbert Dollfuß was born on October 4, 1892, in Texing, Lower Austria. Coming from a modest background, he earned a scholarship to attend the Seminary in Hollabrunn and later studied law in Vienna. World War I profoundly affected him; he served in the Austro-Hungarian Army on the Italian front, an experience that would shape his worldview and political aspirations.

After the war, Dollfuß turned to politics. He joined the Christian Social Party (CSP), then a dominant force in Austrian governance. Thanks to a blend of personal charisma and strong organizational talents, Dollfuß rose quickly through the ranks. In 1932, at just 39 years old, he became Chancellor of Austria—one of Europe’s youngest heads of government at that time.

A Turbulent Tenure
Dollfuß assumed office against the backdrop of severe economic distress and growing political instability. Austria, still reeling from the global impact of the Great Depression, faced soaring unemployment and widespread poverty. On top of that, Austria’s fledgling democracy wrestled with rising extremist movements: National Socialists aspiring to unite Austria with Germany, and a militant socialist opposition.

In an effort to preserve Austria’s independence and quell domestic unrest, Dollfuß made several controversial moves:

Emergency Decree and Suppression of Parliament: In March 1933, a parliamentary crisis allowed Dollfuß to govern by emergency decree. He effectively sidestepped Austria’s democratic institutions, dissolving the National Council (parliament). Critics argue this was the first step toward authoritarian rule. His supporters, on the other hand, claim the move was a desperate attempt to maintain stability during a time of crisis.

Formation of the Fatherland Front: Seeking to forge national unity, Dollfuß established the Fatherland Front in 1933—a single-party entity that combined various conservative, Catholic, and nationalist groups under his leadership. The Fatherland Front was meant to serve as a bulwark against both Austrian National Socialists and Marxist factions.

February Uprising of 1934 and the Dollfuß Constitution: When socialist paramilitary groups resisted Dollfuß’s government, clashes escalated into open violence in February 1934. Government forces quelled the uprising, leading to harsh reprisals and the outlawing of the Social Democratic Party. Later that year, Dollfuß introduced a new authoritarian constitution, further solidifying his power and curtailing civil liberties.

Opposition to Nazism
Despite his authoritarian methods, Dollfuß was adamantly opposed to the growing influence of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime. The Austrian Chancellor viewed the Nazi aspiration to annex Austria—“Anschluss”—as an existential threat to Austrian sovereignty.

In 1933, Dollfuß banned the Austrian Nazi Party and took steps to curb pro-German agitators. This staunch resistance to Hitler’s ambitions earned Dollfuß the support, albeit cautious, of some Austrians who saw his government as a bulwark against Nazism’s expansion.

Assassination and Aftermath
On July 25, 1934, Engelbert Dollfuß was assassinated in a failed coup attempt by Austrian Nazis. He was shot in the Chancellery building in Vienna, dying from his wounds later that same day. His death shocked the nation, and for a moment, it temporarily united Austrians in grief. Though his successor, Kurt Schuschnigg, briefly maintained the authoritarian regime Dollfuß had initiated, Austria would ultimately be annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938.

Historical Debate and Legacy
Dollfuß’s legacy has been the subject of intense debate among scholars, politicians, and the broader public:

Critiques of Authoritarianism: Many historians strongly condemn the erosion of democratic structures under Dollfuß. By dissolving parliament, banning political parties, and centralizing power, he effectively ended Austria’s short-lived experiment with democracy after World War I.

Role in Resisting Nazism: Others point out that Dollfuß’s unyielding stance against Hitler’s Germany momentarily protected Austria’s independence. Supporters emphasize that the Austrian Nazi plot to overthrow him underscores the extent of his opposition to Nazi ideology.

Modern Reevaluation: In contemporary Austria, commemoration of Dollfuß remains a sensitive topic. Streets named after him or plaques in his honor have sparked controversy. While some insist on preserving markers of his historical significance, others demand their removal, citing his authoritarian suppression of civil liberties.

Balancing the Scales
Engelbert Dollfuß’s legacy defies simple categorization. On one hand, he undeniably dismantled democratic institutions and led an authoritarian government that brutally suppressed political opponents. On the other, he stood as a strong adversary to the Nazi regime, facing continual threats to Austria’s sovereignty.

As Austria continues to grapple with its past, Dollfuß stands as a reminder that history often transcends neat moral absolutes. Understanding his era means recognizing the complex interplay of socio-economic distress, the aftershocks of a world war, and the lure of radical ideologies—and how these forces can shape a leader’s decisions, for better or worse.","Generate a news article with the title ""Engelbert Dollfuß – an attempt at a fair portrait"".",fake,1
"Engelbert Dollfuß – an attempt at a fair portrait.

The Austrian Chancellor who became an Austrofascist dictator: a mistake, perhaps built out of good will.

The face of a schoolboy, hardly made older by the moustache; his physique is small, just 1.51 metres tall, his slim figure looks scrawny because of his large head, his posture awkward; his look is trusting, like that of an otherwise well-behaved high school student who has just been caught playing a prank.

More for you: Always trouble with the pensions
When he played a prank on a teacher, not when he carried out a coup.

You wouldn't think that this man with the face and figure of a schoolboy is a dictator. He could be the nice neighbour who takes his dachshund for a walk in the morning and rings the doorbell in his pajamas on Sunday and asks if he could borrow some butter, as he completely forgot to buy some yesterday. Nothing of the grim expression with which Adolf Hitler portrayed himself in photos, nothing of the imperial attitude of Benito Mussolini.

All assessments are biased
Engelbert Dollfuß: You can't get a grip on him. His appearance and his actions don't match, and what has been and is being written and said about him doesn't match either. Everything is biased. For those socialized in the SPÖ, he is the worker murderer, fascist and dictator; for those socialized in the ÖVP, he is the bulwark against Adolf Hitler, the patriot who believed in Austria when hardly anyone dared; a victim of the National Socialists: wounded in an assassination attempt in 1933, murdered in the National Socialist coup attempt on July 25, 1934. The perpetrators watched the seriously wounded man die. They refused to allow him a doctor or a priest to administer the last rites. They let Engelbert Dollfuß die, there is no other way to put it.

The word ""and""
The difficulty in the case of Engelbert Dollfuß is that the word ""and"" would be more accurate than the opposite: a worker murderer and one of the first victims of National Socialism, a fascist and a patriot, a dictator and a bulwark against Adolf Hitler. If one is willing to accept such simplifications at all.

You can't get a grip on him, this Engelbert Dollfuß.

He has been mentally damaged since childhood: Neither his biological father, the miller's assistant Josef Wenninger, nor his foster father Leopold Schmutz care for the illegitimate son of the farmer's daughter Josepha. The boy only feels safe in church when he is serving as an altar boy. He wants to become a priest. The priest Simon Veith persuades Bishop Johann Baptist Schneider to give Dollfuß a scholarship to the prince-archbishop's boys' seminary of the Archdiocese of Vienna in Oberhollabrunn. Dollfuß graduated in 1913. Although he abandoned his theology studies after graduating after a few months and switched to law, he remained loyal to the Catholic Church out of gratitude for having made it possible for him to receive a school education.

He struggled with his short stature. It may be that this became the driving force behind his desire to prove himself at all costs: when he volunteered for the front in Vienna during the First World War and was rejected as unfit, he went to St. Pölten to report to the front once again. This time he was successful.

Did Dollfuß slip into the role of fascist dictator rather than striving for it?

Faith in Austria
As Chancellor, he fought against the general depression after the lost war and the growing desire of politicians and large parts of the population to join big brother Germany. However, he did it with the wrong means. He believes in Austria, but not that democracy could be strong enough to maintain the independence of the country, which did not yet feel like a nation.

His weakness is a tunnel vision focused on the Catholic Church and the farmers. The result is a camp mentality and a resulting inability to engage constructively with the social democracy - which, however, also does nothing to overcome the boundaries with the Christian-social camp.

Who is democratic?

If you try to put yourself in the shoes of a Christian-socially socialized person at the time, you will see that the social democracy makes it difficult for Dollfuß to approach them: their motto ""Democracy is not much / Socialism is the goal"" also does not sound like compliance with democratic rules, and Dollfuß must understand their strategy of fundamental opposition and refusal to cooperate as a declaration of war. Another disturbing factor may be the community buildings of ""Red Vienna"": they are the most progressive social buildings in the world, but internationally

admired and imitated; people with a rural background, however, see them as defensive structures, as fortresses of social democracy - which is confirmed in the battle for the Karl Marx farm during the civil war in February 1934.

Added to this is the gradual rise of National Socialism, which Dollfuß sees as the greatest threat to Austria's independence. Dollfuß apparently suspects that the Social Democrats could side with the National Socialists in favor of Austria's annexation to Germany. At least the Social Democratic opposition leader Karl Renner is in favor of the annexation, which he argues with the peoples' right to self-determination, convinced that the majority of Austrians are behind him.

In a dilemma
Dollfuß sees himself in a dilemma between slogans and systems that all seem to be taking democracy seriously. Therefore, he too constructs a non-democratic system and a form of government without a parliament.

There is no denying that Dollfuss carried out a coup in March 1933 by eliminating parliament and thus democracy. In 1932 he had already ruled without parliament's consent with the War Economy Enabling Act of 1917 in order to solve the banking crisis in his own way. This shaped his thinking: parliament only stood in the way of a quick solution to the problem. Dollfuss was not a born dictator. On March 5, 1933, he became one because he saw no other way out. For him, democracy was now just a Gordian knot that he had to cut.

A lie as a basis
He did not fully trust his own courage. He spread the word that parliament had eliminated itself - a blatant lie: the resignation of all three parliamentary presidents was merely a procedural crisis that could have been resolved in the next session. Dollfuss, on the other hand, used the vacuum to establish his authoritarian form of government.

The outward signs of dictatorships follow one after the other: the abolished death penalty is reinstated and, after the suppression of the Schutzbund uprising, which was similar to a civil war, is carried out on a large scale. In Austrian social democracy, Dollfuß is therefore still considered a ""worker murderer"". The work of competing parties is made more difficult and they are eventually banned.

However, Dollfuß remains consistent in his rejection of National Socialism. This is not empty lip service, because the aversion is expressed even in small things, for example: when all Cartellverband associations (CV) are brought into line in Germany, Dollfuß founds an Austrian offshoot, the ÖCV.

“Dictatorship light”
Dollfuß seeks support to secure Austrian independence, hopes to forge an anti-German alliance with France, Germany’s sworn enemy at the time, and, when the statements remain vague, gets involved with the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and the Hungarian fascist prime minister Gyula Gömbös.

Of course, from today’s perspective, the Austrofascist imitation of fascist and National Socialist representation borders on the ridiculous: audio and film documents show that Dollfuß is not comfortable with the role of the fascist emperor. His language is colored by dialect, the appealing content and the tone from which he laboriously tries to wring pathos do not fit together; his uncertain smile interacts with his sloppy posture, which no uniform can compensate for.

Then the symbols: the crutch cross is supposed to be a swastika, so to speak, without being a swastika; at least one greets ""Österreich heil!"" with reference to the country and not to a person. Dollfuß puts the Catholic Church above all else as God's representative on earth, to whom alone the Austrofascist regime feels obliged, even in its jurisprudence: ""In the name of God, the Almighty, from whom all law emanates, the Austrian people receive this constitution for their Christian German federal state on a class basis."" There is something touching about his gratitude - but that is not the basis for serious politics.

Punch and Judy with death sentences
Dollfuß's fascism is creaking at every seam. Compared to Mussolini's imperial campaigns, Hitler's manic persecution of the Jews and Stalin's ""purges"", the Dollfuß regime could pass as a ""dictatorship light"", an Austrian Punch and Judy as a commentary on the tragedies - were it not for the deaths of the civil war and the death sentences, which were at least highly questionable.

One can give Dollfuß credit for actually believing that Austria could only be saved through a dictatorship. But in the end, the fact remains that Dollfuß's divinely based corporate state was a fascist dictatorship.

The polarizing figure
But could this Engelbert Dollfuß have been a dictator with good intentions?

Otto Habsburg-Lothringen, grandson of Charles I, the last emperor of Austria: ""There is no other country in Europe that has had a chancellor who fell in battle against Hitler. We should be proud of that.""

The Austrian political scientist Anton Pelinka: ""For me, Engelbert Dollfuß is first and foremost a dictator who gave up his democratic beginnings in favor of an explainable, but in my view unjustifiable, path to dictatorship.""

You can't get a handle on him, this Engelbert Dollfuß.

"We’re scared’: Restaurants seek more protection after burglaries.

Jolted by a recent string of overnight burglaries, more than two dozen Palo Alto restaurant owners met with Police Department brass on Monday to get updates on the investigation, swap crime prevention tips and demand better public notification when crimes occur.

The meeting, which was organized by the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce, focused on five overnight restaurant burglaries that took place in the downtown area between Dec. 23 and Dec. 31. These included burglaries at Nola and Local Union 271 where intruders made off with restaurant safes; an incident at Coupa Café where burglars damaged doorways and broke the cashiers; and a burglary at an office operated by the restaurant Tamarind on the night of Dec. 27, according to police Capt. Zach Perron.

There was also an unsuccessful attempt to burglarize 02 Valley, a Taiwanese restaurant on University Avenue, according to Perron.

Perron outlined some of the actions that the police are taking to combat the trend, including increased foot patrols during nighttime and police cars stationed around various downtown locations. He also said that detectives have “promising leads” in their investigation, which he called “very good news.”

While Perron did not provide details about the leads, he suggested that the burglars who targeted Palo Alto may be the same people who committed similar crimes in other communities along the Peninsula and in East Bay communities such as Oakland and San Leandro.

“Once we arrest those responsible, I’d be surprised if the only crimes they have committed are limited to Palo Alto,” Perron said.

For many merchants, the problem was compounded by what they deemed to be inadequate public communication. Police did not publicize the string of burglaries, which only became public after social media posts from a member of the business community.

Nancy Coupal, owner of Coupa Café, said it’s important for police to notify businesses after these types of incidents so that they can take the necessary precautions.

“Nobody knew, and I think that is not a good idea. I think we all need to be informed immediately and for the community to be informed so that there is a lot of eyes looking,” Coupal said.

In her case, burglars broke into the Ramona Street café through the sky light and crawled on the floor to avoid triggering the alarm system. They also broke the cash registers and the doors leading into the café’s office, which did not contain a safe.

Perron advised the merchants and restaurant owners at the virtual meeting to make sure they have a functional and updated alarm system and, if possible, to include an audio monitoring.

“You can often tell if the conversation is surrounded by cleaning supplies or something like that, where we know we’re going into some housekeepers and janitorial folks and not burglaries,” Perron said. “If they’re saying the safe is up here, that’s as good clue for us that we got live bad guys inside the building then.”

He also urged business owners to limit the amount of cash that they have on site, to make sure that their safes are bolted down (even though this measure did not help Nola and Local Union 271), and to call the police if they or any of their employees see suspicious activity like people testing locked doors, looking inside closed businesses or carrying crowbars.

Perron called the string of overnight restaurant burglaries an “anomaly” and said that he does not remember at any point in his career seeing so many break-ins in such a short period of time.

“That doesn’t make it any less real for those of you who have bene victims and who are still dealing with the aftermath of putting your places back together,” Perron said.

Some restaurant owners have already takem action to protect themselves. Megan Kwakab, co-owner of the Patio, said her restaurant has adjusted to the recent burglaries by making it clear to any potential intruder that the restaurant has no money on site.

“We’re scared. We’re not leaving any money. We’re leaving our cash registers wide open,” Kwakab said.

While the meeting was largely focused on overnight restaurant burglaries, some attendees also urged the city to address homelessness and car break-ins in the downtown area. Manuel Martinez, owner of San Agus, said he has seen cases in which homeless individuals slapped customers who declined to give them money.

“What are we doing about that?” he asked. “The burglaries are very important, but safety for employees and patrons are also important.”

Perron said that the department has a two-person “special problems detail” that is charged with working with homeless individuals and ensuring that they know about available social services. Officers are also performing outreach to homeless individuals who stay in public garages, he said.

“The ones who unfortunately get cited, that’s done after they are provided all sorts of resources from us and offered alternatives,” Perron said. “The enforcement arm is the last resort but it’s a constant ongoing task, especially for our night shift and early day shift personnel.”

"We’re scared’: Restaurants seek more protection after burglaries.

We’re Scared’: Restaurants Seek More Protection After Burglaries

In recent months, a surge of burglaries targeting restaurants has left business owners and staff on edge. Across urban centers and small towns alike, eateries have become frequent targets for thieves seeking cash, electronics, and expensive liquor. The uptick in crime is prompting calls for enhanced security measures and stronger partnerships with law enforcement to protect these vital community hubs.

The Growing Threat

Restaurant owners describe break-ins occurring during late-night hours, often with perpetrators smashing windows or prying open doors to gain entry. “It’s devastating,” said Maria Lopez, owner of a family-run café in downtown Portland. “We’ve been here for 10 years, but now every morning I come in wondering if it happened again.”

Police reports indicate that in some cities, restaurant burglaries have doubled compared to previous years. Thieves are not just targeting cash registers; they’re also after high-end equipment, alcoholic beverages, and even digital payment terminals.

Financial and Emotional Toll

The financial impact of these crimes is significant. Repairing broken windows, replacing stolen equipment, and dealing with lost inventory can cost thousands of dollars per incident. “Insurance covers some of it, but there are still out-of-pocket expenses,” explained Jason Nguyen, who manages a popular Asian fusion restaurant. “Plus, you lose business during the time you’re trying to clean up and make repairs.”

Beyond the monetary loss, the psychological toll on staff and owners is equally damaging. Many report feeling anxious and unsafe, particularly those who work late shifts. “We’re scared,” said waitress Emily Harris. “Every noise at night makes us jumpy now.”

Calls for Action

In response, restaurant associations and business coalitions are advocating for:

Increased Police Patrols: Many business owners are urging local governments to allocate more resources for nighttime patrols in commercial areas.

Security Grants: Some municipalities have begun offering grants to help small businesses invest in security upgrades, such as surveillance cameras and reinforced doors.

Community Watch Programs: In neighborhoods where businesses band together to watch for suspicious activity, incidents of burglary have declined.

Investing in Protection

Many restaurant owners are taking matters into their own hands, investing in high-tech security systems. “We installed cameras that alert us in real time if someone tries to break in,” said David Kim, who owns a chain of pizzerias. Others have hired overnight security guards or fortified their premises with metal grilles and reinforced glass.

Striking a Balance

While security upgrades are necessary, some business owners worry about creating an unwelcoming atmosphere for customers. “We don’t want to turn our restaurant into a fortress,” said Sarah Patel, who co-owns a café known for its open and inviting ambiance. “But at the same time, we need to protect ourselves.”

The Way Forward

Experts emphasize the importance of community collaboration in tackling this issue. “When businesses, law enforcement, and residents work together, we see better outcomes,” said Detective James Parker. He recommends that restaurants document incidents thoroughly, share information, and remain proactive about security.

As restaurants continue to grapple with these challenges, their resilience and determination remain evident. For many owners, their businesses are more than just sources of income—they are cornerstones of their communities. Protecting these establishments is about safeguarding not just livelihoods, but the vibrant cultural fabric they represent.

"In gender equality move, Kerala Police drops 'policeman' from passing-out parade oath.

In a significant move towards gender equality within the police force, the Kerala Police have revised the oath taken during its passing-out parade. The update removes the gender-specific term 'policeman' and replaces it with the term 'police personnel' to ensure equal representation for both male and female recruits.

On January 3, Additional Director General of Police(ADGP, Law&Order) Manoj Abraham, who holds the charge of DGP, issued a circular on behalf of the Home Department announcing the change. The new wording now states, ""I swear to perform my duties and responsibilities as a police personnel,"" replacing the previous phrasing, ""I swear to perform my duties and responsibilities as a policeman."" In the past, terms such as ""woman police constable,"" ""woman head constable,"" ""woman sub-inspector,"" and others were prohibited by a 2011 directive from the State Police Chief.

As per Section 87 of the Kerala Police Act, 2011, every member who joins the Police Force under this Act shall, on satisfactory completion of training, take an oath (in the prescribed format) before the appointing authority or an officer nominated by him.

Here's a translation of the modified oath:

"In gender equality move, Kerala Police drops 'policeman' from passing-out parade oath.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, January 10, 2025 - In a significant step towards gender inclusivity, the Kerala Police Academy has modified its traditional passing-out parade oath, removing the gender-specific term 'policeman' in favor of more inclusive language. The change was implemented during today's graduation ceremony at the Police Academy in Thrikkakara, where 245 new officers took their oath of service.
The decision comes as part of broader efforts by the Kerala government to promote gender equality within its law enforcement ranks. The modified oath now uses gender-neutral terms such as 'police officer' and 'member of the force' throughout the ceremony.
""This change reflects the evolving nature of our police force and our commitment to creating an inclusive environment for all officers, regardless of gender,"" said State Police Chief K. Padmakumar. ""Language matters, and we want our ceremonial practices to reflect our values of equality and respect.""
The Kerala Police force has seen a steady increase in women officers over the past decade, with female representation now standing at 18% of the total force strength. The state has been actively working to achieve a 25% representation target by 2027.
Assistant Commissioner of Police Priya Lakshmi, who headed the committee responsible for reviewing and updating ceremonial practices, noted that the change was welcomed by both male and female officers. ""This isn't just about changing words; it's about changing mindsets and creating a more equitable workplace culture,"" she said.
The modified oath maintains its solemn promise to serve and protect citizens while upholding constitutional values and human rights. The ceremony, steeped in tradition dating back to 1954, remains largely unchanged except for the updated language.
Kerala has been at the forefront of progressive policing practices in India, having earlier introduced several women-friendly initiatives including pink patrol vehicles and she-lodges for female officers. The state was also among the first to implement gender-sensitivity training as a mandatory component of police training.
The move has garnered positive responses from civil society organizations and police reforms advocates, who view it as a symbolic but important step in breaking down gender barriers in law enforcement. Similar changes are being considered by police academies in other Indian states.
As the sun set over the parade grounds in Thrikkakara, the graduating class, comprising 142 male and 103 female officers, took their oath together, marking a new chapter in the state's policing history.","Generate a news article about the city of Thiruvananthapuram, with the title ""In gender equality move, Kerala Police drops 'policeman' from passing-out parade oath"".",fake,1
"After disruptions, Boulder council to take next few meetings online.

Boulder, CO — Following recent disruptions during in-person meetings, the Boulder City Council has announced it will temporarily shift its proceedings to a virtual format for the next several weeks. The decision, revealed late Monday evening, comes amid growing concerns over safety, accessibility, and the ability to maintain decorum during public sessions.

The disruptions in question occurred during the council’s last two in-person meetings, where heated debates over controversial city policies led to interruptions from attendees. Protesters reportedly shouted over council members, and one meeting had to be adjourned early due to escalating tensions.

“While we value public participation and the passion our community brings to these discussions, we also have a responsibility to ensure our meetings are productive and respectful,” said Mayor Aaron Brockett in a statement. “Moving online is a temporary measure to help us maintain order while continuing to serve the public effectively.”

The shift to virtual meetings is not unfamiliar territory for the council. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the city’s business was conducted almost entirely online, using platforms like Zoom to facilitate public participation. While the council resumed in-person meetings in mid-2022, many community members continued to advocate for hybrid or remote options to improve accessibility.

The disruptions that prompted the decision were tied to contentious discussions on housing development and climate action policies. While the council has not released specific details about future security measures for in-person meetings, several members hinted that the pause would allow the city to reassess protocols and potentially implement changes.

“This isn’t about silencing anyone,” said Councilmember Junie Joseph. “It’s about creating a space where everyone—council members, staff, and the public—feels safe and heard. We’ll continue to welcome robust dialogue, but it needs to happen in a way that doesn’t derail the process.”

Not all community members are pleased with the decision. Several local activists criticized the move as an attempt to distance the council from public accountability. “Taking these meetings online makes it harder for marginalized voices to be heard,” said Sofia Martinez, a Boulder resident and housing advocate. “It feels like a step backward.”

City officials, however, emphasized that the online format would include features to facilitate public participation, including live streaming, call-in options, and real-time public comment opportunities. Meeting schedules and access details will be posted on the city’s website.

The council plans to revisit the decision in a month, with the possibility of resuming in-person meetings depending on community feedback and the effectiveness of any new measures.

“This is a balancing act,” said Brockett. “We’re trying to ensure transparency, accessibility, and safety all at once. Our hope is that this temporary shift helps us move forward constructively.”

The next city council meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, January 16, and will be accessible via Zoom. Residents can visit Boulder’s official website for instructions on how to join and participate.

"After disruptions, Boulder council to take next few meetings online.

Boulder’s City Council will hold its next few meetings virtually in response to protests and disruptions at recent in-person meetings.

On Thursday night, council members voted 7-2 to move the Jan. 16 and Feb. 6 meetings online. A Jan. 23 study session was already scheduled to be a virtual meeting.

The decision to move the meetings to virtual comes as as ferocious community debate and protest over the war in Gaza has continued to roil the council chambers. There is a provision in city code that allows council members to exclude or limit members of the public from attending meetings in person when “a public health or safety concern exists.”

Although protesters have been a near-constant presence during open comment at council meetings for more than a year, tensions and anger over the war flared up at the Dec. 19 council meeting, forcing the council into a nearly 15-minute recess. After that meeting, some council and community members expressed feeling unsafe.

Councilmember Matthew Benjamin and Mayor Pro Tem Lauren Folkerts voted against holding the meetings virtually. Councilmember Taishya Adams said she had intended to vote no, as well, but mistakenly voted yes.

“Having a handful of people run us out of our own building, I think, sends a really bad message to our community,” Benjamin said at the meeting, adding that going online would be a choice to “abdicate our leadership and responsibility.”

Adams said she wanted to honor community members’ right to protest and allow people to speak to the council in-person.

“I believe we need to stand firm for our community members to be able to talk to us to our face, and to … figure out mechanisms to be able to do that,” she said.

But other council members said that temporarily moving meetings online would buy the council time to decide how to handle disruptive people and behaviors at meetings going forward.

“(I) would not characterize this as being run off, but instead a brief pause while we reassess our responses to some of the disruptions that we’ve seen in council chambers to make sure that we can keep all attendees of our meetings safe,” said Mayor Aaron Brockett.

There will also still be open comment periods during the virtual Jan. 16 and Feb. 6 meetings, Brockett told the Daily Camera.

The Dec. 19 council meeting was far from the only meeting that’s been disrupted by protesters, but it was one of the more dramatic recent examples. Shouting, chanting and confrontations among audience members erupted after Boulder resident Evan Ravitz spoke during open comment. He became angry and cursed at council members, which appeared to also set off protesters and others in the audience.

Ravitz later told the Daily Camera that he became angry in part because people in the audience repeatedly interrupted him and council members did not give him enough time to finish his speech. A few minutes earlier, he said, he also had a sign that he was holding with his feet while he used his hands to finish writing his speech, but Brockett told him he needed to hold his sign with his hands. Ravitz said he did not believe he had broken any rule.

In response to the commotion, Brockett called a recess, the council retreated to another room and it took nearly 15 minutes to clear the protesters out of the council chambers. They then moved downstairs and continued protesting.",https://www.dailycamera.com/2025/01/10/after-disruptions-boulder-council-to-take-next-few-meetings-online/,real,0
"Legal challenge on N.B. abortion access is over.

A lawsuit against the New Brunswick government over access to abortion is officially over.

The Canadian Civil Liberties Association has discontinued the legal action that was intended to force the province to fund procedural abortions in clinics outside hospitals.

The case was launched four years ago but became redundant on Nov. 7, when newly elected Premier Susan Holt announced her cabinet had repealed a section of a provincial regulation that prevented funding clinic abortions.

A consent order to discontinue the case, agreed to by the CCLA and the province, was filed with the Court of King's Bench on Jan. 7 and approved by a judge on Jan. 9.

Before the change, Medicare could only fund procedural abortions in hospitals, and only three hospitals — two in Moncton and one in Bathurst — offered it.

Holt and Health Minister John Dornan said, when the ban was repealed, that the province would reclassify the procedure as minor surgery, revise the fee structure for doctors performing it and work with them to make it more widely available.

The consent order ending the case awarded no legal costs to either side in the dispute.

It brings to a close a decades-long legal saga that began when the Liberal government of Frank McKenna adopted the regulation in an effort to block Dr. Henry Morgentaler from performing abortions in a Fredericton clinic he opened in 1994.

According to Martha Paynter, a reproductive health expert at the University of New Brunswick, 70 per cent of abortions in the province are now done via mifepristone, a prescribed medication, meaning a shrinking demand for procedural abortions.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/legal-challenge-on-n-b-abortion-access-is-over-1.7430097,real,0
"Legal challenge on N.B. abortion access is over.

A long-standing legal battle over abortion access in New Brunswick, Canada, has officially come to an end, with the conclusion of a significant legal challenge. This marks a pivotal moment for reproductive rights in the province, which has been at the center of debates surrounding abortion services for years.

The case, which centered on access to abortion services outside of hospitals in New Brunswick, had sparked widespread public discussion on the accessibility and legality of abortion across Canada. The challenge began when a group of activists and healthcare providers sought to expand access to the procedure, particularly focusing on the province’s restrictions and logistical barriers that prevented individuals from obtaining timely services.

The Legal Battle
New Brunswick, while legally required to provide abortion services under the Canada Health Act, had historically maintained policies that created barriers for those seeking the procedure. The province’s healthcare system had only offered abortion services at hospitals, and there were few private clinics where the procedure could be performed. Additionally, some patients faced long waiting times, as well as bureaucratic hurdles that made accessing abortion services difficult, especially for those living in rural areas.

At the heart of the legal challenge was the fight to improve access to abortion services outside of hospitals, which could alleviate wait times and ensure that people had more options in terms of location and timing. This lawsuit also sought to address the lack of government funding for clinics that performed abortions outside of hospitals.

The case gained national attention, as reproductive rights advocates argued that the restrictions in New Brunswick were not only out of step with the broader Canadian commitment to healthcare equity but also violated the rights of individuals seeking to exercise their reproductive freedoms.

What Led to the Conclusion?
The legal challenge recently came to a conclusion after years of litigation and advocacy. The New Brunswick government, in response to mounting pressure and legal scrutiny, opted to settle the case. While the terms of the settlement have not been fully disclosed, sources indicate that the resolution will allow for expanded access to abortion services, both in hospital settings and in private clinics. Additionally, the provincial government has agreed to ensure that no unnecessary delays or barriers are put in place for those seeking reproductive health services.

The conclusion of this legal challenge is seen as a significant win for reproductive rights advocates, who have fought for years to ensure that abortion access is not only legally guaranteed but also practically accessible.

Implications for Reproductive Rights in Canada
The end of the legal challenge in New Brunswick holds broader implications for reproductive rights across Canada. While abortion has been legal in Canada since 1988, access to the procedure has varied significantly from province to province. The situation in New Brunswick had become a focal point in the broader national debate about healthcare access and the rights of individuals to make decisions about their own bodies.

The resolution of this case is a positive development for those advocating for reproductive justice, signaling that access to abortion services cannot be restricted by logistical or bureaucratic barriers. This legal victory may prompt other provinces to reassess their policies around abortion care, ensuring that individuals across Canada have equitable access to reproductive health services.

Furthermore, it sends a clear message about the importance of safeguarding reproductive rights and ensuring that healthcare policies are designed with the needs of individuals in mind, rather than political or ideological agendas.

Looking Forward
While this legal victory marks a significant step forward for reproductive rights in New Brunswick, advocates remain vigilant. There are ongoing concerns about potential future challenges to abortion access, both in New Brunswick and across the country. Ensuring that reproductive rights remain protected requires continued activism, legal vigilance, and public support for policies that prioritize health and equality.

As this legal challenge concludes, it serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting reproductive freedoms, ensuring that everyone, regardless of where they live, has the right to make their own healthcare decisions without undue interference or delay.","generate me a new article based of this title:

"LA crews race to halt wildfires ahead of high winds.

Weather forecasters in California are warning fierce winds which fuelled the infernos around Los Angeles are expected to pick up again this week, as fire crews on the ground race to make progress controlling three wildfires.

Officials warned that after a weekend of relatively calm winds, the notoriously dry Santa Ana winds would pick up again from Sunday night until Wednesday, reaching speeds of up to 60mph (96km/h).

Ahead of the wind's uptick, some progress has been made in stopping the spread of the deadly Palisades and Eaton fires, which are burning on opposite ends of the city. Local firefighters are being assisted by crews from eight other states, as well as Canada and Mexico, who continue to arrive.

In a news conference on Sunday, officials said that 16 people have been confirmed dead, and another 16 remain missing.

They also warned that the death toll is expected to rise as urban search and rescue crews sweep the ruins using cadaver dogs.

Three conflagrations continue to burn around Los Angeles.

The largest fire is the Palisades, which has now burnt through more than 23,000 acres and is 11% contained.

The Eaton fire is the second biggest and has burnt through more than 14,000 acres. It is 27% contained.

The Hurst fire has grown to 799 acres and has been almost fully contained.
While crews have managed to start containing the largest fires, authorities have warned the incoming wind event could lead to ""potential disastrous wind conditions"", with the whole of LA County put under fire threat.

""Unfortunately, we're going right back into red flag conditions with some potential disastrous wind conditions between now and Wednesday, with the peak winds expected to be on Tuesday,"" Pasadena fire chief Chad Augustin told the BBC.

""While we're making some progress, the end is not even close yet,"" he said.

Kristin Crowley, the fire chief for the city of LA, called for residents near evacuation zones to be prepared to flee if an order is issued, and to stay off the roads as much as possible in order to not hinder crews.

Topanga Canyon resident Alice Husum, 67, told the BBC a new fire that began in the area overnight was quickly contained, but that she and her neighbours are all ""dreading Tuesday"" when the wind speeds are likely to peak.

But Ms Husum, who has stayed behind despite evacuation orders, notes that the forecast ""is a little better than the 100 mile-gusts that were hammering us"" earlier in the week.

New fires continued to flare up on Sunday, threatening communities in the San Fernando Valley and near Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

On Sunday, firefighters were able to quickly stop the spread of new fires in the Angeles National Forest, which surround the facility that is at the heart of the US space programme and contains top secret technology.

At least 29 people have been arrested for looting in mandatory evacuation zones. Two people were caught posing as firefighters in order to steal from evacuees.

Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said in a news conference Sunday he had requested more National Guard troops to bolster the 400 already in the area. California Governor Gavin Newsom has since announced that 1,000 additional members of the National Guard would be deployed.

""When I was out there in the Malibu area, I saw a gentleman that looked like a firefighter. And I asked him if he was okay because he was sitting down. I didn't realise we had him in handcuffs,"" Sheriff Luna told reporters.

""We are turning him over to LAPD because he was dressed like a fireman, and he was not. He just got caught burglarising a home. So those are issues that our front-line deputies and police officers are dealing with.""

There are now 14,000 firefighters in the southern California region, being assisted by 84 aircrafts and 1,354 fire engines, said Sheriff Luna.

Evacuation numbers have dropped, with around 105,000 residents still under mandatory evacuation orders and 87,000 under evacuation warnings.

Deanne Criswell, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), told CNN on Sunday that a significant threat remained.

""I know that so many people probably want to get back into the area and check on their homes, but with winds picking back up, you never know which way they're going to go,"" she said.

LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell said that limited access had been allowed to evacuated residents over the weekend, but that his officers are once again barring all residents from returning.

Officials have issued repeated orders for drone operators to not fly near fire zones, and are now seeking information after a drone crashed into a vital plane.

The FBI has shared photos of the small drone which on Thursday collided with a plane known as a ""Super Scooper"", one of the world's most affective firefighting aircrafts, briefly grounding it.

The drone ripped a 3-by-6-inch (8-by-15cm) hole in the plane.

Officials have also warned of scammers seeking to take advantage of victims, and issued a stern warning that anyone caught price gouging will be prosecuted.

Meanwhile the spat between California Governor Newsom and President-elect Donald Trump continues.

Trump, who takes office on 20 January and has been invited by the governor to come tour the fire damage, on Saturday blamed ""incompetent"" politicians for ""one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our country"".

Newsom, who is a Democrat, has in turn attacked Trump for sharing misinformation about the fires.

In an interview on Sunday with NBC, Newsom called Trump's false claims ""inexcusable"".

"LA crews race to halt wildfires ahead of high winds.

Firefighters in Southern California are racing against time to contain multiple wildfires as forecasts predict high winds that could exacerbate the blazes. With red flag warnings in effect, crews are working around the clock to establish fire lines and deploy resources in an attempt to prevent the flames from spreading further.

The largest fire, currently burning in the Angeles National Forest, has already scorched thousands of acres and forced evacuations in nearby communities. Authorities are on high alert as gusty winds could push the fire into new areas, posing additional risks to homes and infrastructure.

“We are doing everything possible to stop the spread of these fires, but the changing winds make it incredibly difficult,” said Fire Chief Maria Gomez. “Our primary goal is to protect lives and property.”

In response, the National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for much of Los Angeles County, predicting wind gusts up to 50 mph. Crews are focused on building containment lines while aerial units drop water and fire retardant from above.

Officials urge residents in fire-prone areas to remain vigilant and follow evacuation orders as needed.

"Rapidly-changing road conditions ahead, Arctic air moves in with more snow.

As winter tightens its grip, the weather is delivering a stark reminder of its unpredictable nature. A surge of Arctic air is descending across the region, bringing more snow and rapidly-changing road conditions that demand vigilance from travelers.

The Arrival of Arctic Air
A potent Arctic air mass is sweeping down from the north, sending temperatures plunging well below average. This frigid air is combining with an active storm system, creating ideal conditions for snow to spread across vast areas. Forecasters are predicting accumulations ranging from a few inches in some regions to over a foot in higher elevations.

Challenging Road Conditions
The sudden temperature drop is causing widespread freezing, turning wet roadways into sheets of ice. Compounding the issue is the heavy, blowing snow, which reduces visibility and creates drifting. Highway departments are deploying crews around the clock, but with snow falling at rates of one to two inches per hour in some areas, roads are likely to remain treacherous for extended periods.

Key Safety Tips for Travelers
For those who must travel, preparedness is crucial. Here are some tips to navigate these challenging conditions safely:

Check the Forecast: Stay updated with the latest weather and road condition reports before heading out.
Slow Down: Reduced speeds can significantly improve your ability to react to icy patches or sudden drifts.
Pack an Emergency Kit: Include blankets, water, non-perishable snacks, a flashlight, and a fully charged phone in case you become stranded.
Ensure Vehicle Readiness: Check that your tires have adequate tread, your windshield wipers are functioning properly, and your antifreeze levels are sufficient.
What to Expect in the Coming Days
Meteorologists warn that the Arctic blast may linger, with additional snow showers expected in its wake. Temperatures will struggle to climb above freezing, keeping snow and ice in place and prolonging hazardous conditions. Strong winds accompanying the cold air may also lead to wind chills well below zero, further emphasizing the need for caution and proper winter gear.

Conclusion
As the Arctic air settles in, it’s vital to remain alert and adaptable. Whether commuting to work, running errands, or traveling long distances, make safety your top priority. With a little preparation and a lot of patience, we can weather the storm and stay ahead of the rapidly-changing road conditions.","write an article for me that has the following title

"Danbury's new soccer team Spice City FC prepares for first home match: 'We’re ... a soccer city'.

Danbury, CT — January 10, 2025* — Danbury’s newest sports sensation, Spice City FC, is gearing up for its inaugural home match, promising an exciting new chapter for soccer fans in the city. The team, named after Danbury’s rich cultural diversity and vibrant community, is set to take the field for its first home game this weekend at Danbury Stadium, and fans are already buzzing with excitement.

""We’re here to make history,"" said coach Carlos Rivera at a press conference Thursday morning. ""Danbury has always been a city of passion, of energy, and now it’s time for us to show the world that we’re more than just a city of great food, great culture — we’re a soccer city.""

Spice City FC, named after Danbury's nickname, ""Spice City,"" which nods to its historical significance in the spice trade, was founded last year. The team quickly became a symbol of the city’s drive to foster athletic talent and community pride. The club joins the growing ranks of lower-division teams in the U.S. soccer landscape, competing in the National Independent Soccer Association (NISA).

The match will see Spice City FC face off against rivals from across the region, and the energy surrounding the team is palpable. Local businesses, schools, and residents have all rallied behind the squad, with banners, merchandise, and team colors popping up throughout the city. The club’s colors — a bold combination of orange and purple — are a nod to both the vibrancy of Danbury's cultural heritage and the team's ambitious goals.

“I can’t wait to see the team take the field,” said local fan Sarah Johnson. “We’ve been waiting for something like this for so long. We have soccer fans here, and we’ve been craving a team to call our own. It’s amazing to see this dream become a reality.”

Spice City FC’s roster features a mix of local talent and experienced players from around the country. The club’s leadership is committed to building a team that reflects both the diversity and spirit of Danbury itself.

“We want the team to embody everything that makes Danbury special,"" said team captain Daniel Torres. ""It’s not just about playing soccer; it’s about bringing people together, creating something that the whole community can be proud of.""

Local businesses are already seeing the impact of the team's arrival. Restaurants, bars, and shops in downtown Danbury have introduced special promotions to celebrate the team’s first home game, with some even offering discounts for fans who wear the team's merchandise.

""We’ve seen a boost in business just from the buzz surrounding Spice City FC,"" said Maria Gonzalez, owner of a popular local café. ""People are excited, and it’s great to see the community coming together. It’s a real win for Danbury.”

As the team’s opening match approaches, fans are preparing for a celebration of sport, culture, and community. The match will feature pre-game festivities, including live music, food trucks, and family-friendly activities. Organizers are expecting a packed stadium, with tickets selling out quickly as the home opener draws near.

For Rivera and the Spice City FC team, this weekend’s match is only the beginning. ""We’re not just here to play soccer,” he said. “We’re here to build something lasting, something that will grow with this city. Danbury’s ready for soccer, and we’re ready to give it everything we’ve got.""

With their first home match fast approaching, Spice City FC is ready to make a mark on the local sports scene — and prove that Danbury truly is a soccer city.

"Danbury's new soccer team Spice City FC prepares for first home match: 'We’re ... a soccer city'.

DANBURY — James Baculima, a new midfielder for Spice City FC, said his “legs are buzzing” ahead of his team’s inaugural home game in front of a possible sellout crowd this Sunday at Danbury Ice Arena. 

Spice City FC, the city’s new Major Arena Soccer League 2 team, will play the first of its six home games at the Danbury Ice Arena on Jan. 12, hosting Baltimore Arsenal. The match will kick off at 3 p.m.

Baculima was among the Spice City FC team members who on Thursday joined team executives as well as Danbury Mayor Roberto Alves and Union Savings Bank President and CEO Chelen Reyes for a news conference. The latter was on hand to celebrate the new season's launch as well as announce a new partnership between the team and the bank.

Spice City owner and general manager Matt Svanda said he is grateful for the new partnership with the bank. The team faced skepticism when it approached other potential sponsors about the endeavor.

“They’ve done so much in the community already. For us to have our founding partner be someone that’s so trusted in the community and has already done so much, it’s a dream come true. The players are excited. The on the field product we’re really excited about. It’s competitive. We have a lot of work ahead of us. It’s a passion project and I’m really grateful for where it’s going,” Svanda said.

Reyes said the bank believes in the team.

“The first time it was brought to our attention that there is an opportunity to do this we jumped on it,” Reyes said. 

“We felt that it was something the bank can support in terms of its alignment in our efforts to continue to support the city of Danbury, where we really look for ways to get communities to come together, families to get together, help local businesses, put the name of Danbury out there and promote our team,"" Reyes said. ""We’re very proud to be part of this effort. We know that it’s not a short term thing for us.”

The team and city leaders have extolled the addition of professional arena soccer as a local entertainment option for the Danbury community, describing it as an affordable, high energy and family friendly sport.

Spice City FC joins a growing number of professional sports teams that call Danbury Ice Arena home. The arena is also the home rink for the Danbury Hat Tricks ice hockey team, which competes in the Federal Prospects Hockey League. In 2024, arena leaders announced that a new arena football team, the Danbury Diesel, will also call Danbury Ice Arena its home turf.

Kyle Liddy, the team’s president of operations, said the journey toward launching the team started 10 months ago. 

“Spice City FC was a dream really,” he said, explaining that team leaders combed the state to find out where would make the most sense as a home base for soccer in the region. “We had feet on the street, just kind of getting a pulse on the city, just seeing how soccer would be appreciated here, and you’re going to see close to a sellout crowd this Sunday at the Danbury Ice Arena with close to 2,500 people here for the first-ever Major Arena Soccer League 2 game in the city of Danbury.

“This city is an amazing place to host a soccer game,” he said. 

Alves is similarly excited.

“I can’t believe it’s been 10 months … I remember the first time we came down here you had a packed house,” Alves said. “... We’ve always been known as a hockey city, but this is a home run because we’re also a soccer city. We’re a sports city. We support our teams.”

Svanda outlined a vision for each Sunday during home games. 

“The dream for me, it truly is [when] Spice City is playing … The drums are out, people are marching to the arena, businesses are excited because they’re going to have more business that day, people buying things, people celebrating, that is my dream down the road. Right here with the ice arena at the center,” Svanda said.

For Baculima, alhough he has been playing professionally for three years, he said he’s always wanted to come back to his home city to play.

So Sunday is the day he’s been waiting for. 

“To come play for Danbury is going to be my dream come true: coming home,” said Baculima, wearing his team’s new gray home jersey.",https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/danbury-ice-arena-hosts-baltimore-soccer-match-20023403.php,real,0
"Cartagena is the favorite city of all Colombians and the cheese: Turbay's comment after constant controversy in X.

Cartagena has become a topic of debate on social networks, specifically on X, where many users compare its tourist attraction with other destinations in the country.

Although some express their discontent and affirm that Cartagena “is not a good destination” to visit, there are a large number of defenders of the city who highlight its benefits and attractions.

In this context, President Dumek Turbay shared a video showing the celebration of December 31 in the Historic Center, where you can see the large influx of people. A citizen named Camilo commented that “the more they 'cancel' it in X, the more it gets crowded,” suggesting that the city remains a popular destination despite the criticism.

"Cartagena is the favorite city of all Colombians and the cheese: Turbay's comment after constant controversy in X.

By Maria González
Political Correspondent
January 10, 2025
In another controversial social media moment, David Turbay, the recently appointed Minister of Culture, sparked heated debate with a peculiar statement about Colombia's historic coastal city of Cartagena, comparing it to cheese and declaring it universally beloved by all Colombians.
""Cartagena is like cheese - everyone loves it. It's simply impossible not to. Just as all Colombians adore cheese, they all love Cartagena. This is not up for discussion,"" Turbay posted on his X account yesterday evening, promptly generating thousands of responses and reactions across the platform.
The statement came after weeks of ongoing criticism regarding his management of cultural heritage sites in the coastal region, particularly concerning the restoration projects in Cartagena's historic center. Opposition leaders and cultural preservation experts have questioned several of his recent decisions about renovation permits in the walled city.
Local historian Carmen Rodríguez called the minister's comparison ""reductive and concerning."" In a response that gained significant traction, she wrote, ""Reducing Cartagena's complex cultural heritage and socioeconomic challenges to a simplistic food analogy demonstrates a concerning lack of understanding about the city's real issues.""
The controversy has also highlighted ongoing debates about tourism management and gentrification in Cartagena's historic district. Community leaders have long expressed concerns about rising property prices pushing local residents out of traditional neighborhoods.
""While the Minister makes light-hearted comparisons, real Cartageneros are struggling with serious issues that deserve proper attention,"" said Jorge Martínez, leader of the Local Community Action Board. ""We need concrete policies, not social media soundbites.""
When reached for comment, Turbay's office defended the post as an attempt to ""inject some levity into public discourse"" while maintaining that the Minister remains seriously committed to addressing Cartagena's cultural heritage challenges.
This is not the first time Turbay has sparked controversy on social media. Last month, his comments about traditional cumbia dance generated similar backlash, leading to a public apology and subsequent deletion of the post.
The incident has reignited discussions about the appropriate use of social media by public officials, with political analysts noting the growing trend of government representatives using informal communication styles on platforms like X.
Meanwhile, opposition lawmakers have announced their intention to request a formal hearing to discuss the Ministry of Culture's current policies regarding Cartagena's heritage sites, suggesting that Turbay's social media presence may have more serious political consequences than anticipated.
As this story develops, the incident serves as yet another example of how social media statements by public officials can quickly escalate into larger political debates about governance and cultural policy in Colombia.",What would a news article with the title 'Cartagena is the favorite city of all Colombians and the cheese: Turbay's comment after constant controversy in X' look like?

"No time to be bored! 'Nowon Thin Thin Snow Sledding Hill' with plenty of winter fun.

The Nowon Thinsing Sledding Hill, which opened on December 26th last year, is a representative winter playground in Nowon-gu, Seoul, and was crowded with visitors during the vacation season. The Nowon Thinsing Sledding Hill, located at the Seoul National University of Science and Technology Sports Complex, is scheduled to operate until January 26th, and will be closed on January 16th and 20th.

It is open from 10 AM to 5 PM every day. The admission fee is free for Nowon-gu residents, Nowon-gu Office employees, and Seoul National University of Science and Technology students and employees, and 2,000 won for residents of other regions. However, children under 36 months are free, and there is a verification process upon entry, so you must bring your ID and other necessary documents.

Nowon Thinsing Sledding Hill has facilities such as a sledding hill, ice rink, snow play park, ice fishing, curling and traditional play experience center, amusement facilities, rest facilities, and a medical office. The sledding hill and ice rink operate for 45 minutes and 15 minutes of rest, and the snow play park has a 30-minute rest period from 12:30 to 1:00 PM.

"‘People are scared, people are terrified’: Custodial staff still overworked, disrespected by UG2, fear reprisal.

Custodial workers employed under the facilities management company UG2 say they continue to endure overwhelming workloads and a lack of basic respect, fueling an atmosphere of fear on the job. Multiple workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, describe a culture in which they feel intimidated by supervisors, are given inadequate rest breaks, and face mounting pressure to complete tasks beyond what they consider feasible or fair.

“People are scared, people are terrified,” said one custodian who has worked for the company for more than three years. “Anytime we try to speak up about unsafe working conditions or unfair schedules, there’s always this fear that we’ll get fired or have our hours cut.”

Several custodians report working six-day weeks and, in some cases, double shifts to meet demands. One worker mentioned having to clean multiple floors of a building single-handedly in a short time frame—responsibilities that used to be divided among at least two or three employees. “They treat us like we’re invisible,” said the worker. “We’re told to move faster, to be more efficient, but they don’t seem to realize how physically exhausting it is.”

The concerns do not stop with work overload. Custodians also mention a tense environment in which they rarely feel comfortable voicing opinions or reporting problems to management. One employee described a recent confrontation: “I reported a safety issue—chemicals were incorrectly labeled, which can be dangerous—and I was told to mind my own business. It’s not right.”

Union representatives, when contacted, indicated they have been aware of these grievances for several months and are exploring options, including potential legal recourse and additional employee support programs. “We’ve advised our members to document any unsafe or unjust conditions,” said a union spokesperson. “Workers shouldn’t live in fear of losing their livelihood for speaking out.”

UG2 did not respond to repeated requests for comment by press time.

Meanwhile, custodians say they are holding on to hope that speaking out will yield changes, whether through the union, the company itself, or higher authorities. “We’re working through the exhaustion for now,” shared one longtime staff member. “But we need respect, and we need to be heard. We’re not asking for miracles—just basic dignity and fair treatment.”","‘People are scared, people are terrified’: Custodial staff still overworked, disrespected by UG2, fear reprisal

"‘People are scared, people are terrified’: Custodial staff still overworked, disrespected by UG2, fear reprisal.

Carnegie Mellon began its custodial contract with UG2 in January 2023, replacing Aramark, which had been on campus since 2015. This meant custodians at Carnegie Mellon, who are represented by Service International Union local 32BJ, were managed by a new leadership team. 

Founded in 2012, UG2 is a relative newcomer to the facilities service industry. Their website highlights their work in facility services in higher education and emphasizes “unheard-of levels of service for schools you’ve definitely heard of.” This includes Stanford, where in February The Stanford Daily published “Inside UG2 at Stanford: Surveillance, favoritism, intimidation” about UG2’s mistreatment of the custodial workers on their campus. 

In March, The Tartan published “‘We’re like bodies with no heads’: UG2 violates union contract, mistreats custodial staff,” highlighting the issues that the custodial staff were facing on our campus. UG2 executives visited campus one week after publication, and workers hoped that this would signify a change.

It has been over six months since The Tartan’s report, and workers are still frustrated. 

The Tartan spoke with six custodians working on campus through UG2, all of whom requested anonymity over fear of reprisals. As one worker said, “People are scared, people are terrified.” 

At least one worker was told by their supervisor not to speak to reporters from The Tartan. 

The conversations painted a picture of a staff that feels overworked, disrespected, and all too aware of the precarity of their position. Expressing a common sentiment, one custodial worker said, “We’re not humans to them. We’re numbers, we’re dollar signs. They don’t care about our bodies, they don’t care about our families, as long as we’re there to make them look good.”

Prevented from grieving 

Thomas “Tom” Gravely began working at Carnegie Mellon in the summer of 2011, when campus custodial services were contracted to Integrated Service Solutions. He worked in housing services, covering Stever last year and Forbes Beeler this year.

Gravely passed away on Nov. 21. 

Multiple workers told The Tartan that his passing hit the team hard. As one custodian put it, “There was a grey cloud here. Now that he passed, it’s a thunderstorm.”

Gravely’s viewing and funeral service were scheduled for last Friday, and The Tartan spoke to multiple workers that were unsure if they would get the time off they needed to attend. There is a point system for workers where they receive one point for a tardy, and two points for an absence, with an apparent threshold of 13 points resulting in a firing. We write apparently, as it seems that many workers would already be over the threshold were it not for points not being tracked properly through the transition from Aramark to UG2. 

Additionally, some workers reported receiving different amounts of points for the same offense. Workers were worried that they would receive a point for going to the viewing, but many went anyway to show their love. 

The workers were eventually given a two-hour window to pay their respects, but they were informed of this late enough that many did not get to see him. “They want us to pick between our home lives and our job,” one worker said.

Workers also reported that they needed a doctor’s note for absences, with one worker adding, “If we have a family emergency we can’t leave for anything. We’re like prisoners here.”

Complaints of understaffing

Every worker interviewed by The Tartan mentioned understaffing as a serious issue. 

Some workers believe that this is due to UG2 potentially overreporting their amount of contracted employees to Carnegie Mellon. One person interviewed believes that the number of UG2 janitors on campus could be as low as 100, and thinks that UG2 is reporting over 200 workers to Carnegie Mellon, potentially including employees that were terminated.

When asked by The Tartan in March 2024 about the staffing levels, Kathryn Leary wrote that “in 2020, custodial staff increased by approximately 10 custodians and has remained consistent since then, with staffing currently at approximately 170 custodians.” This number is around 30 less than the staff count reported the year before on Jan. 1, 2023, despite UG2’s claims of not having laid off any workers since 2020.

The Tartan attempted to get more recent estimates of custodial staff employed by UG2 on campus from both UG2 and the Carnegie Mellon Facilities Management Services. UG2 “decline[d] to respond to questions about workforce-specific details related to our operations at Carnegie Mellon University,” and Charity Anderson, Director of Facilities Operations at Carnegie Mellon, wrote that the “custodial staffing levels remain consistent. CMU continues to be committed and engaged in supporting our employees and successfully delivering custodial services across campus.”

The alleged understaffing could also be aggravated by what appears to be a rather high turnover rate. Staff mentioned “los[ing] coworkers due to small things like punching out a second or two late,” and that managers seem eager to fire workers before they have a suitable replacement.

Many staff reported feeling like they were purposefully being pushed out, and that conditions are intentionally being made poor because “they would rather have people quit so they don’t have to fire them.” 

Additionally, workers who have been working on campus for years have said they feel as if they are being pitted against the new hires, who are allegedly being hired and promoted into positions over the workers with more seniority. UG2 and Carnegie Mellon declined to share if and how many workers had been fired or hired.

The understaffing is severe enough that workers reported managers occasionally working cleaning shifts, which is in violation of the union contract and was also brought up when reporting was first done by The Tartan in March. 

Frustration goes beyond management

Some of the custodial staff do not feel properly represented by their union, SEIU 32BJ. In a conversation with two workers, they said that: “Our union is terrible. We can’t get in touch with anybody. They agree to everything that [UG2] say[s]. It’s like dealing with snakes in the grass.” 

Another worker echoed this, saying that the union is allowing people to get fired without putting up a fight. 

Some workers believe that the scope of managing custodial work for the entire Carnegie Mellon campus is too much for UG2. “I think UG2 is broke. I think they underbid it, CMU is way too much for them, and they cannot handle everything that CMU is asking of them,” one worker said.

Workers mentioned needing to spend time on their shifts looking for supplies that aren’t where they should be and attending safety meetings describing safety protocols involving equipment that the workers do not have, when they could instead be using this time to clean and complete relevant tasks.

Student Impact

Multiple custodians interviewed mentioned that Carnegie Mellon students were a motivator for their work, and mentioned “the students appreciate us more than [UG2 does].” 

Cleaning all the buildings, and the dorms especially, clearly provides a great service to Carnegie Mellon students, but staffing issues have led to days where only one worker will be there to clean an entire building. Even at times like Family Weekend, staffing stays low.

Workers reported being overworked in the weeks leading up to the new students’ arrival in late August, and that conditions in some dorms were so poor that “when the kids were coming back, none of their rooms were done.” 

Managers waited until September to give delayed write-ups, terminating workers once they were no longer needed. Students living on-campus this year corroborated this, mentioning a “mad cleaning scramble,” and seeing parents come in for move-in day to still-dirty rooms. 

Changes in management

There has been significant turnover among the UG2 managerial staff working at Carnegie Mellon. Allegedly, six managers have either quit or been fired, including the site manager Doug Hastings in October, whose name still appears on the Carnegie Mellon Custodial Services webpage. Hastings and UG2 were asked about this, but did not respond. The Site Manager position appears to still be open.

Workers are wondering  Carnegie Mellon will replace UG2 with a different management company in 2025.

Carnegie Mellon was asked about new contract bidding but did not respond. The current contract between the union and UG2 expires Dec. 31, 2027.",https://the-tartan.org/2024/12/09/people-are-scared-people-are-terrified-custodial-staff-still-overworked-disrespected-by-ug2-fear-reprisal/,real,0

"Technology powers paneer production amid soaring global demand.

Bengaluru, India – In a city renowned as the Silicon Valley of India, the fusion of tradition and technology is driving a revolution in food production. Bengaluru-based startup DairyTech Innovations has unveiled a state-of-the-art automated paneer production facility, responding to a surge in global demand for the popular Indian cottage cheese.
Paneer, a staple in Indian cuisine, has been gaining international popularity due to its versatility, nutritional benefits, and increasing interest in vegetarian diets. According to the Indian Dairy Association, exports of paneer have risen by 35% in the past year, with key markets in North America, Europe, and the Middle East.
DairyTech Innovations, headquartered in the heart of Bengaluru’s startup ecosystem, is leveraging AI-driven automation and IoT-enabled monitoring systems to streamline the traditionally labor-intensive paneer-making process. The company’s flagship facility in the city’s Whitefield area integrates precision-controlled heating, curdling, and pressing mechanisms, ensuring consistent texture and quality.
“Traditionally, paneer production has relied on manual methods, which can be time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies,” explained Rohan Sharma, CEO of DairyTech Innovations. “With our technology, we’ve not only scaled up production but also ensured every batch meets international standards for taste and quality.”
The process begins with high-quality milk sourced from local farmers, which is tested for purity using advanced sensors. AI algorithms optimize the curdling process, adjusting temperature and coagulant quantities in real-time to achieve the perfect consistency. IoT sensors monitor every stage, alerting operators to any deviations from optimal conditions. The final product is packaged in eco-friendly materials, aligning with the startup’s sustainability goals.
This technological leap has resonated with local dairy farmers, who have seen their incomes grow due to increased demand for high-quality milk. The company has partnered with over 200 farmers in the outskirts of Bengaluru, providing them with training, equipment, and guaranteed purchase agreements.
“This initiative has transformed our livelihoods,” said Lakshmi Gowda, a dairy farmer from nearby Tumakuru. “The emphasis on quality and fair pricing has motivated us to improve our practices and invest in better cattle care.”
Industry experts believe Bengaluru’s blend of technological expertise and agricultural heritage makes it a natural hub for innovations in the dairy sector. “The city’s ability to attract talent and investment is a game-changer for traditional industries like dairy,” said Dr. Meera Iyer, a food technologist based in Bengaluru.
DairyTech Innovations has already set its sights on expanding operations, with plans to open similar facilities in other major Indian cities and explore partnerships with international food distributors. As global appetite for paneer continues to grow, Bengaluru’s tech-driven approach is positioning it as a key player in the dairy export market.
For a city already synonymous with technological advancements, this marriage of innovation and tradition is yet another feather in Bengaluru’s cap.","Write a news article based on the news title provided to you about a local news taking place in the city of Bengaluru.

"Technology powers paneer production amid soaring global demand.

Bengaluru: Paneer, the soft, creamy cheese at the heart of so many Indian dishes, is undergoing a transformation. From curries to snacks, this protein-packed dairy favourite has been a kitchen staple for generations. However, as demand for paneer soars in India and the global market, traditional methods of production are struggling to keep up. One of the key advancements is the adoption of automated coagulation systems. These systems carefully regulate pH, temperature, and acid addition, delivering a product with perfect texture and yield every time. Continuous whey separation systems, meanwhile, replace the laborious task of manual handling, maintaining optimal moisture in the curd with high precision. Fully automated heating systems ensure uniform pasteurisation at 90°C, eliminating the inefficiencies of traditional batch processes and enabling seamless, high-throughput production, according to industry experts participating in the three-day Southern Dairy Summit-2025, organised by the Indian Dairy Association (South Zone), which started in the city Thursday. For decades, paneer production was largely a manual affair. Milk was coagulated with acids like citric acid, whey was separated by hand, and the final product was cut manually. While this hands-on approach worked for small-scale operations, it often led to uneven texture and taste, inconsistent moisture levels, and hygiene concerns owing to direct handling. Labour-intensive and time-consuming, traditional methods also struggled to keep pace with modern market demands. ""Mechanisation is a game-changer. With automated systems, we're seeing consistent quality that was impossible with manual methods. The texture, taste, and moisture are uniform, and contamination risks are drastically reduced because there's minimal human contact,"" Kirit Patel, founder of Flavi Dairy Solutions, said. He highlighted how the paneer market is growing: ""Globally, the market was valued at $9.8 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $23.2 billion by 2030, with an annual growth rate of 8.7%. India, the largest consumer, has seen its market swell from Rs 570 billion in 2023 to a forecasted Rs 1,848 billion by 2030, growing at an impressive 14% annually. Meeting this demand requires innovation, and automation appears to be the answer."" For consumers, these advancements mean better paneer — more hygienic, tastier, and reliably consistent. For producers, it means the ability to meet the soaring demand without sacrificing quality, all the while lowering production costs and boosting efficiency, concluded Patel. HJ Shankaralinge Gowda, a dairy safety and management professional at Karnataka Milk Federation, highlighted paneer's growing appeal as a protein source. ""Proteins come from two primary sources: Animal-based and plant-based origins. Paneer is nutritionally almost equivalent to animal-based proteins and has become a preferred option for vegetarians. Paneer is carving out a space in both Indian and global markets as a protein-rich alternative to animal-based sources like poultry and eggs,"" he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/technology-powers-paneer-production-amid-soaring-global-demand/articleshow/117129276.cms,real,0
"Map shows how much snow Pittsburgh area will get, starting during Friday evening's commute.

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — Another round of snow is expected to dump a widespread 1 to 3 inches across the Pittsburgh area, starting during the Friday evening commute. 

The snow moves in right around 5 to 6 p.m. Friday and will continue through the first part of the day on Saturday, with a widespread 1 to 3 inches through the morning. North of Pittsburgh, along with the Laurel Highlands and the ridges, could see 2 to 4 inches. 

There will still be a few flakes through the day but most of the then-lake effect snow in the afternoon will linger in the Laurel Highlands and ridges and north, which is why those areas are seeing higher accumulation possible. 

A winter weather advisory goes until 1 a.m. Sunday. If you're traveling on Saturday, be careful. 

On Sunday, the Pittsburgh area's highs try to get closer to normal near freezing but they're still trending below normal for temperatures through mid to late January. 

Next week, the region has several more mornings with lows in the teens and single digits with highs only in the 20s so the snow on the ground will stick around and the frigid weather is here to stay for a while.

Remember: if it's too cold for you it's too cold for your pets so bring them inside.

Pittsburgh says ""hiccup"" with salt delivery won't affect treatment

Pittsburgh Public Works said its road crews are monitoring the snow and will activate winter weather protocols to treat over 1,200 miles of city streets.

""Just to be fully transparent, we had a slight hiccup with Three Rivers Terminal and our delivery of salt this week. That was factors beyond the city's control or even Three Rivers' control,"" said Pittsburgh Public Works Director Chris Hornstein.

He says they were impacted by Winter Storm Blair.  

""We did have to pivot a little bit on the types of salt that we have, but that is just a hiccup from our perspective,"" he said. 

It means the salt they have been bringing in over the past day, with more coming on Saturday, does not have magnesium in it. 

""It works down to 17 degrees. It'll be mixed in with magnesium salt. Again, the temps are predicted to be above 17 degrees. So we don't have any cause for concern,"" he said.

"Map shows how much snow Pittsburgh area will get, starting during Friday evening's commute.

PITTSBURGH — As winter weather makes its way across Pennsylvania, residents in the Pittsburgh area should brace for snow starting during Friday evening’s commute. A new forecast map released by the National Weather Service (NWS) details how much snow is expected across the region, with accumulations varying significantly by location.

According to the NWS, the first flakes will begin falling around 5 p.m., coinciding with rush hour. The heaviest snowfall is expected between 7 p.m. and midnight, creating potentially hazardous driving conditions. Road crews are already preparing to treat major thoroughfares, but officials urge commuters to leave work early if possible or use public transportation to avoid the worst of the storm.

Accumulation Forecast

The snowfall map indicates:

Pittsburgh City Proper: 2-4 inches

Northern Suburbs (Cranberry, Wexford): 3-5 inches

Southern Suburbs (Bethel Park, Upper St. Clair): 2-3 inches

Eastern Suburbs (Monroeville, Murrysville): 3-4 inches

Western Areas (Moon, Robinson): 2-4 inches

Higher Elevations (Laurel Highlands): 5-8 inches

Meteorologists explain that the higher snow totals in the Laurel Highlands are due to the area’s elevation and colder temperatures, which allow for more snow to accumulate.

Impact on the Commute

The timing of the snowstorm couldn’t be worse for evening commuters. ""This storm is expected to create slippery roads and reduced visibility,"" said Rachel Harper, a meteorologist with the NWS. ""Drivers should allow extra time to reach their destination and keep a safe distance from other vehicles.""

PennDOT has activated its winter weather response plan, deploying salt trucks and plows to keep roads as clear as possible. However, officials warn that untreated secondary roads may become especially treacherous.

Weekend Weather Outlook

The snow is expected to taper off by early Saturday morning, leaving behind a fresh blanket of snow. Temperatures on Saturday will hover in the mid-20s, keeping the snow in place through the weekend. Residents planning outdoor activities or holiday shopping are advised to bundle up and proceed with caution.

As always, stay tuned to local weather updates for the latest information and prepare your vehicle with an emergency kit in case of delays.

The heaviest snowfall is expected between 6 PM and 11 PM, coinciding with the evening rush hour, which could lead to hazardous travel conditions.

Impact on Friday Evening Commute

City officials are warning drivers to exercise caution, as road conditions are likely to deteriorate rapidly once the snow begins. Public Works Director Emily Carver stated, “Our crews will be out salting and plowing throughout the storm, but we urge residents to plan ahead and avoid unnecessary travel if possible.”

Several major highways, including I-376 and I-79, are expected to experience delays. PennDOT has announced that it will implement reduced speed limits on key roadways and has positioned additional resources to address potential trouble spots.

School and Business Closures

While no closures have been officially announced as of Friday morning, several school districts and businesses are closely monitoring the forecast. Parents and employees are advised to stay tuned for updates through official channels.

Winter Weather Preparation Tips

Residents are encouraged to take the following precautions:

1) Stock Up on Essentials: Ensure you have enough groceries, medications, and other supplies to last through the weekend.
2) Prepare Your Vehicle: Check tire pressure, top off windshield washer fluid, and keep an emergency kit in your car.
3) Shovel Early and Often: Shoveling light snow frequently is easier than tackling heavy accumulations later.

Looking Ahead

The snow is expected to taper off by early Saturday morning, leaving behind cold temperatures and icy conditions. Meteorologists predict a high of 28°F on Saturday with a low of 18°F, which could prolong icy spots on untreated surfaces.

"1934 - when Austrians shot at Austrians.

VIENNA, Austria – Eight decades may have passed, yet the tumultuous events of February 1934 continue to reverberate through Austrian society. It was a time when internal divisions escalated into open conflict—a brief but bloody civil war that pitted Austrians against one another in the streets of their own cities. Today, historians and citizens alike look back at “the February Uprising” with a mix of sorrow, regret, and a fervent hope that such violence will never again be repeated.

A Nation on the Brink
By the early 1930s, Austria was reeling from severe economic hardship sparked by the Great Depression. Soaring unemployment and widespread poverty fueled political extremism on both the left and right. In 1932, Engelbert Dollfuß—a relatively unknown figure—assumed the role of Chancellor, inheriting a deeply polarized country struggling to maintain a fragile democratic framework.

Amid the unrest, two camps crystallized:

The Social Democrats (SDAP), backed by organized labor and their paramilitary defense force, the Schutzbund.
The Federal Government, led by Dollfuß and supported by conservative, Catholic, and nationalist forces, including the paramilitary Heimwehr.
When Dollfuß dissolved parliament in 1933 and began ruling by decree, tensions mounted. The Social Democrats, fearing the loss of democratic freedoms, openly defied government crackdowns.

Sparks that Lit the Fuse
In February 1934, Austrian authorities initiated an aggressive search of the Social Democrats’ party premises in Linz. The action was intended to uncover hidden arms caches and quell socialist opposition. Instead, the raid quickly escalated into street clashes, and within days, fighting erupted in several Austrian towns and cities, including Linz, Vienna, and Graz.

For the first time since Austria became a republic in 1918, soldiers and police forces loyal to the government fired upon their fellow Austrians—primarily workers and socialist militants—and, in some places, Austrian paramilitaries even turned weapons on each other. The term “Austrians shooting at Austrians” became a stark reminder of just how deeply partisan and bitter the political landscape had become.

Days of Violence
The February Uprising, also known as the Austrian Civil War, lasted from February 12 to 16, 1934. Key features of the conflict included:

Urban Battlegrounds: In Vienna’s working-class districts such as Floridsdorf and Simmering, barricades and blockades emerged. Schutzbund fighters aimed to defend socialist strongholds, while government forces used artillery and armored cars to break their resistance.

Casualties and Aftermath: Within just a few days, the fighting left hundreds dead or wounded. Many of those who lost their lives were workers on the front lines of the socialist movement. In the aftermath, authorities arrested and tried leading Social Democrats, dissolving the party and placing Austria under a single-party authoritarian rule.

Control Over the Media: Government censorship stifled independent reporting, meaning much of what transpired was not fully documented until later. Contemporaneous newspapers, predominantly controlled by pro-government interests, were quick to label the Social Democrats as instigators, while socialist publications that existed “underground” pointed the finger squarely back at Dollfuß’s government.

Impact on Austria’s Democracy
The February Uprising dealt a crushing blow to Austria’s fledgling democracy. The Dollfuß government’s response—outlawing the Social Democratic Party, banning strikes, and sharply curtailing individual freedoms—set the stage for a centralized authoritarian regime under the newly formed Fatherland Front. Although Dollfuß himself was assassinated by Austrian Nazis just months later, his successor, Kurt Schuschnigg, continued many of Dollfuß’s policies.

In many ways, the events of 1934 represented the last stand of Austrians trying to preserve multi-party democracy against a rising tide of authoritarianism. By March 1938, with the Anschluss (the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany), Austrian sovereignty and what remained of democratic governance vanished altogether.

Remembering a Painful Chapter
The February 1934 clashes remain a sensitive subject in Austria’s collective memory. Some hold fast to the belief that the Social Democrats’ violent resistance was a necessary stand against creeping tyranny. Others contend that Dollfuß took extreme measures to prevent Austria from capitulating to either Nazi or communist forces.

Today, memorials across Austria quietly acknowledge the loss of life on both sides of the conflict. In Vienna, plaques and small monuments mark the sites of pitched battles, serving as sober reminders of a society deeply fractured along political and ideological lines.

Lessons for the Present
Modern Austria has long since become a peaceful democracy with robust civic institutions. Yet the specter of 1934 endures as a warning of what can happen when political polarization reaches a breaking point. Historian Dr. Elisabeth Hofer, who has written extensively on Austria’s interwar period, observes:

“Whenever we recall 1934, we must remember how vital democratic institutions truly are. Austrians turned on each other because they lost faith in shared discourse and compromise. That lesson is relevant not just for Austria, but for any democracy.”

Even decades later, “1934 – when Austrians shot at Austrians” stands out as one of the darkest episodes in the nation’s modern history. Commemorating the event today is both a memorial to those who perished and a stark reminder that the bonds binding a society must be protected, lest fractures turn neighbors into enemies once again.","Generate a news article with the title ""1934 - when Austrians shot at Austrians"".",fake,1
"1934 - when Austrians shot at Austrians.

On February 12, 1934, a civil war began that claimed hundreds of lives. To this day, the SPÖ and ÖVP argue about who was to blame.

What happened on February 12, 1934 in Austria?

In the interwar period, the major political parties in Austria had armed units. On the side of the Christian Socials (forerunner of the ÖVP) it was the Heimwehr, on the side of the Social Democrats it was the Republican Schutzbund. The hatred between the camps was great. The civil war between government forces and the Schutzbund began in Linz when the police wanted to search the Hotel Schiff early in the morning on February 12, 1934 in order to dig up a weapons depot. The Schutzbund leader Richard Bernaschek had already informed the Social Democratic party leader Otto Bauer in Vienna that he would not put up with this and would resist violently. The party leadership tried to stop Bernaschek from doing so - unsuccessfully. The Schutzbund opened fire on the executive. Little by little, other Schutzbund units in Linz, Vienna, Upper Austria and Styria also took up arms. The fighting had begun.

More for you: Dollfuß causes trouble in Mank
Why did the uprising fail?
The Social Democrats' uprising was completely chaotic. A good portion of the leadership of the Republican Schutzbund had previously been arrested, which made coordinated action against the police, federal army and home guard impossible. The workers who were ready to fight often did not know where their weapons depots were. Many Schutzbund members did not want to fight from the start - the government's military superiority was too obvious. The party leadership around Otto Bauer acted hesitantly and confusedly. A general strike, which from the insurgents' point of view would have been absolutely necessary, was only implemented sporadically. The Schutzbund was on the defensive from the start, the workers barricaded themselves in the municipal buildings, which, isolated from each other, began a hopeless fight against the Federal Army and the Home Guard.

How many people died?
The war ended on February 15 and the uprising was crushed. The exact number of victims is still unclear. Researchers estimate that there were around 350 deaths. There were more than 100 victims on the police and army side, and about the same number of Schutzbund members were killed. The rest were innocent civilians. Nine Schutzbund members were executed, including the Social Democratic National Council member Koloman Wallisch and the seriously wounded Karl Münichreiter from Vienna, who had to be carried to the gallows.

Was this the end of democracy in Austria?
No. February 12, 1934 marked the destruction of social democracy in Austria and the final transition to dictatorship. Democracy had already been undermined much earlier by the Christian Social government under Engelbert Dollfuß. Plans for this had been in place since 1932. In March 1933, all three National Council Presidents (including Karl Renner) resigned in a National Council vote in connection with railway strikes. The MPs dispersed late in the evening without reaching a result. The Christian Social Chancellor Dollfuß used the crisis to shut down parliament and establish a dictatorship. He used the so-called War Economy Enabling Act of 1917 to do this. When the MPs wanted to reconvene in parliament, they were prevented from doing so by the police. Later, the KPÖ, the NSDAP, the Schutzbund and finally the social democratic SDAP - the predecessor of the SPÖ - were banned. The Dollfuß government also paralyzed the Constitutional Court and reintroduced the death penalty. There was to be only one party, the Fatherland Front. However, the corporate state that Dollfuß wanted, based on the Italian fascism of Benito Mussolini, remained essentially an illusion. The concept was not at all suitable as a successful alternative to Adolf Hitler's National Socialism.

How does the ÖVP assess Dollfuß as a person, the dictatorship and February 12th?

As the Christian Social Chancellor, Dollfuß is part of the ÖVP party's history. Until recently, his portrait hung in the ÖVP parliamentary club and was only removed during the renovation of the parliament. There is disagreement about how the period 1934-1938 should be called. ÖVP leader and Federal Chancellor Karl Nehammer recently caused a stir with the statement that he had no problem with the term ""Austrofascism"", after all, on the socialist side one had to speak of ""Austromarxism"". Most ÖVP politicians are still against the label “fascist” because it applies to National Socialism, which is not comparable to the Dollfuss regime. They prefer “authoritarian government”, “chancellor dictatorship” or “Dollfuss-Schuschnigg dictatorship”. According to an older ÖVP narrative, Dollfuss, who died in July 1934 at awas murdered in a Nazi coup attempt, the ""hero chancellor"" or ""martyr"" who courageously opposed National Socialism and gave his life for it. This portrayal is slowly fading.

How do the Social Democrats see it?

Dollfuß and his successor Kurt Schuschnigg, who was chancellor until the ""Anschluss"" to Hitler's Germany, are clear enemies here. Dollfuß was often referred to as a ""worker murderer"". Today it is pointed out that the Social Democrats were on the right side of history at the time and defended democracy. The term Austrofascism is used generally in the SPÖ, and the ÖVP is required to distance itself ""clearly and unambiguously"" from the regime of the time. They want a ""clarification"".

Who was to blame for the traumatizing political debacle of 1934?

After the Second World War, the two major camps, the SPÖ and the ÖVP, agreed on the theory of ""shared guilt"". That was important at the time in order to eliminate the old hatred and make a new start together. But of course this theory does not stand up to a scientific examination of the facts. The great interpreter of Austrian history, the late Hugo Portisch, divided the blame at a ratio of 70:30 to the detriment of the Christian Socials. Many on both sides disagree with that, and it could probably be argued about endlessly. What is clear is that it was the Christian Socials with the fascist Heimwehr and not the Social Democrats who ultimately succumbed to the authoritarian temptation.

Is there also criticism of the Social Democrats' actions at the time?
There are experts who believe that the Austrian Social Democrats (SDAP), as the party with the most votes, should have formed a grand coalition with the Christian Socials after the 1930 elections - then the hostility would not have turned so violent. The SDAP also relied more on the streets than on the power of parliament, they say. In retrospect, that is true, but at the time the situation was already so charged that cooperation between the camps, which became normal in the Second Republic, seemed unthinkable. The political scientist Norbert Leser also argued that the Austrian Social Democrats had frightened the bourgeoisie and made the situation worse with ""radical phrases"" while at the same time taking a very moderate approach. The Linz Program of 1926, for example, spoke of a ""dictatorship of the proletariat"", a Marxist term that may have unsettled some Christian Socials. In contrast to Dollfuß, the SDAP never had any concrete plans to undermine democracy and take power in the country by force.

How was the civil war of 1934 viewed in Austria after 1945?
After 1945, the conflict-laden topic was pushed to one side. The civil war was taboo and was ignored in order to be able to rebuild the country in red-black unity after the destruction of the Second World War. But that did not prevent the topic from remaining subliminally virulent. The unresolved conflict keeps cropping up. Most recently, former top manager Wilhelmine Goldmann, who is close to the SPÖ, put forward the thesis in her new book ""Red Bandits"" that the hatred and mistrust of the ""bourgeoisie"" towards the ""socialists"" has been evident since the interwar period and has continued to this day. When the SPÖ went into opposition under Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, for example, there were frequent comparisons with Austrofascism by SPÖ politicians. The topic is fraught and not resolved.

How did the civil war after 1945 affect Austria's domestic policy?

At the beginning of the Second Republic, it was particularly difficult for the Social Democrats to work amicably with the oppressors of the past. Mistrust and the need for security were great on both sides, which is why the proportional system, unique to Austria, developed, which, in a weakened form, can still be observed today. Power was divided between red and black, right down to insignificant positions or areas, in such a way that decisions could only be made with the involvement of the other side and in a compromise form. This contributed to the political system of the Second Republic remaining stable, in contrast to the First Republic. But over time it undoubtedly led to a certain stagnation and a climate hostile to innovation.

Will there be a joint commemoration of the SPÖ and the ÖVP on February 12, 2024 on the 90th anniversary?

No. This was ruled out in advance by the SPÖ at the request of the WZ. It was clear who the perpetrators were and who the perpetrators were. r victim. There will be no joint action with an ÖVP that is still attached to Dollfuß. The SPÖ wants to hold all memorial events alone. In 2014, Chancellor Werner Faymann (SPÖ) and Vice Chancellor Michael Spindelegger (ÖVP) laid a wreath together at the Central Cemetery in memory of the victims of the civil war. At the time, it was said that they wanted to put what they had in common before what divided them.

Why are the events of February 12th important today?
The civil war shows how quickly the rules of democracy can be suspended and by what means, which at first seem inconspicuous, this happens. In the interwar period, there was no battle with weapons at the beginning, but rather there were apparently minor glitches in parliamentary procedure. Then the government paralyzed the judiciary and the Constitutional Court. In recent years, there have been repeated political attacks on the independent judiciary. Examples such as Hungary or Poland show how easy it is to restrict democratic freedoms in general, even when there are elections. One important lesson from 1934 is undoubtedly not to see a political competitor as an enemy or even a mortal enemy, but at most as an opponent with whom a compromise must be found. In principle, it is about accepting differences and recognizing that people have different opinions. And it requires the willingness to stand up for and defend these democratic values ​​and freedoms. All of this failed in the First Republic.",https://www.wienerzeitung.at/a/1934-oesterreicher-schossen-auf-oesterreicher,real,0

"Pittsburgh region withstands whiplash of winter storm’s snowfall, subfreezing temperatures.

PITTSBURGH — Residents across the Pittsburgh region woke up to a winter wonderland on Saturday as a fierce storm blanketed neighborhoods with up to eight inches of snow. The storm, which began late Friday night, also brought biting winds and subfreezing temperatures, creating challenging conditions for travel and daily activities.

The National Weather Service (NWS) issued winter storm warnings across western Pennsylvania, with meteorologists warning of rapidly deteriorating road conditions and icy surfaces. Temperatures plunged to the low teens overnight, with wind chills making it feel closer to zero in some areas.

Road Crews Work Overtime

Local and state road crews worked around the clock to keep major highways and streets clear. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) reported deploying over 300 plows and salt trucks throughout Allegheny County and surrounding areas. Despite these efforts, several minor accidents and vehicle spinouts were reported, particularly on untreated secondary roads.

“Our teams are doing everything they can to stay ahead of the storm,” said Karen Green, a spokesperson for PennDOT. “We’re urging drivers to stay home unless absolutely necessary.”

Air Travel Disrupted

The storm also caused significant disruptions at Pittsburgh International Airport, where dozens of flights were delayed or canceled. Airlines advised passengers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. Crews worked to de-ice planes and clear runways, but visibility issues persisted throughout much of the morning.

Communities Come Together

Amid the harsh weather, Pittsburgh residents showcased their resilience and sense of community. In neighborhoods like Squirrel Hill and Bloomfield, neighbors teamed up to shovel sidewalks and assist elderly residents. Local shelters extended their hours to provide warmth and food for those in need.

“We’ve been handing out blankets, gloves, and hot meals,” said Sarah Adams, a volunteer at a downtown shelter. “It’s heartwarming to see people come together during tough times.”

Utility Challenges

The heavy snowfall and gusty winds led to scattered power outages, affecting thousands of households across the region. Duquesne Light Company reported that crews were working to restore electricity as quickly as possible, though the conditions slowed their progress. By Saturday afternoon, power had been restored to most affected areas.

More Snow on the Horizon?

While the worst of the storm has passed, forecasters are keeping an eye on another system expected to move through the region early next week. Though less severe, it could bring additional snow and sleet, potentially complicating cleanup efforts.

“We’re not out of the woods yet,” warned NWS meteorologist Jenna Wallace. “Residents should remain vigilant and prepared for more wintry weather.”

Looking Ahead

As Pittsburgh braces for what could be a long winter, city officials are urging residents to stock up on essentials, check on vulnerable neighbors, and exercise caution when venturing outdoors. Despite the challenges, the region’s resilience and preparedness are proving more than a match for Mother Nature.

“This is Pittsburgh,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “We’re tough, we’re united, and we’ll get through this together.”","generate a news article with title ""Pittsburgh region withstands whiplash of winter storm’s snowfall, subfreezing temperatures""",fake,1
"Pittsburgh region withstands whiplash of winter storm’s snowfall, subfreezing temperatures.

A major winter storm battered the eastern region of the United States with snow and bone-chilling temperatures on Monday, although the Pittsburgh region was largely spared the worst of it.

David Shallenberger, lead meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Moon, said the storm ended up producing snowfall about 4 to 6 inches less than originally expected across the region, with Pittsburgh recording 1 to 3 inches by 6 p.m. Monday.

Outlying areas, including Fayette, Greene and Westmoreland counties, saw upwards of 6 inches. Within NWS Pittsburgh’s coverage area, the worst was seen in West Virginia’s Tucker County, where 10 inches of snow fell.

The heavy snowfall eventually tapered into isolated showers by Monday night as the storm continued to shift eastward, Mr. Shallenberger said. But the frigid conditions are here to stay throughout the week, with temperatures expected to remain below freezing until Sunday.

Polar vortex keeps much of the U.S. in its icy grip
Daytime highs for Tuesday will hover in the mid to low 20s, with lows around 10 degrees. A “minor disturbance” on Wednesday is expected to bring lake-effect snow showers, but significant accumulation is unlikely.  

“What that usually does is reinvigorate our northwest winds, but with what I’m looking at, it’s going to be minor,” he said.  

In 2024, an unseasonably warm winter contributed to one of the lowest snowfall totals in Pittsburgh history. The 2023-24 snow season saw just 16.3 inches — far below the 44.1 inches the region averaged from 1991 to 2020. Despite the recent whiplash of cold and snow, Mr. Shallenberger said it’s too early to tell what the winter season will bring. 

“We have surpassed our normal snow amounts for this year so far, but we could easily warm up in February and be below normal,” he said. 

Allegheny County’s Department of Public Works began treating roads with calcium chloride Sunday, deploying 60 to 70 trucks to clean up the roadways.  

“We have 24-hour coverage,” said Stephen Stanley, public works director. “Crews will be on the roads until everything is clear.”

A winter weather advisory for Allegheny County went into effect at 7 p.m. Sunday and expired at 7 p.m. Monday. Counties to the south and east also fell under winter storm warnings.

Pittsburgh Regional Transit reported bus delays of up to 20 minutes on Monday, with additional crews deployed to keep the transit stations and rail lines clear. Washington County’s transit system saw delays and service disruptions as well. 

The Monongahela Incline temporarily shut down, and shuttle vans offered services to riders from the incline’s upper station to Station Square below.

While Pittsburgh International Airport remained operational, the weather conditions still disrupted some travelers’ plans. More than 25 arriving flights saw delays and six cancellations were reported as of 7 p.m. Monday.

Throughout the day, more than a dozen departing flights didn’t leave on time, and four flights were canceled. Most disruptions involved flights to the Washington, D.C., area and other parts of the East Coast, where heavier snowfall was reported.

School districts across the region canceled classes, sending kids and families to enjoy the day sled riding at places like Schenley Park and Sunny Slopes Field in South Park.

The frigid temperatures and snow also wiped out most of the WPIAL basketball games scheduled for Monday night.

Four WPIAL boys games were postponed and 43 of 57 girls games were called off. Only 14 girls games were played Monday and all of them were at schools either north or west of the city.

Eighteen girls games were rescheduled for Tuesday night and a few for Wednesday. Others will be played later in the month.

Social service providers across the region step up 
Confronting a sudden whiplash of snow and freezing temperatures, efforts were quickly underway to provide shelter and support for the region’s most vulnerable populations. 

The Allegheny County Department of Human Services told the Post-Gazette in a statement Monday that its outreach teams have been actively encouraging people to seek overnight shelter and daytime support. The newly opened North Side winter shelter has been averaging around 60 guests per night.

During the day, those in need can access warmth, food and support services at Second Avenue Commons in Downtown, which operates with expanded hours from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. 

Wendy Parkin, senior manager of emergency shelter services at Pittsburgh Mercy, said the number of people seeking assistance at the daytime engagement center have already been trending high since Pittsburgh saw snow accumulation last week. But when the advisory hit Monday, the center saw one of its busiest days so far this winter season. 

By the afternoon, the engagement center was accommodating 75 people, nearing its capacity of 84. 

While managing high demand, Ms. Parkin said new policies, such as early signups for the 40-bed overflow slots and new transportation services coordinated by DHS, have been a welcome improvement. People no longer have to wait in the cold in hopes of a nighttime bed. 

“The people we serve don’t have to wonder, where am I going to lay my head tonight?” Ms. Parkin said. “They know first thing in the morning whether they’re staying there at a shelter or whether they’re being triaged to one of the other overflow shelters.” 

In Beaver County, The Cornerstone has been addressing winter challenges with its warming centers and emergency shelter services.

This marks the second winter that the organization has operated its 24-hour, 20-bed men’s shelter, which provides support to help guests transition into permanent housing. That has provided an additional 7,000 nights of shelter, helping to relieve some of the demand this winter. 

Executive Director Marie Timpano said while encampments aren’t as visible in Beaver County, that doesn’t mean there isn’t a homelessness crisis. Outreach teams were dispatched early in the day Monday to check on people sheltering under bridges, in the woods and other remote areas. 

Ms. Timpano said the abrupt swings in the weather made it difficult for people to prepare. The shelter has seen an increase in elderly people seeking shelter assistance, many of whom have mobility or health challenges that require additional care and make them more vulnerable on the streets. 

“We are having to keep our finger on the pulse of what’s happening and adjust accordingly,” Ms. Timpano said. “But outreach has done a great job and building trust with the community.”

At City Mission in Washington County, demand for meals spiked. The shelter, which normally serves around 10 to 15 people during its community lunches, saw triple that number Monday — serving 35 guests. Some people asked to stay overnight. 

Anticipating the need for emergency shelter to grow, Leah Dietrich, the director of residential programs, said City Mission would open its emergency shelter doors earlier than the usual 10 p.m. time. If needed, the shelter will add 10 overflow cots. And in worst-case scenarios, staff will make arrangements at local hotels. 

“When these things happen and hit so suddenly, I am concerned that people will not get to safety the way that they need to,” Ms. Dietrich said. “We definitely don’t want anybody out in this today, and because we’re one of the only places in our area that would be open, we want to make sure that we’re meeting that need.”

In New Castle, City Rescue Mission is also navigating the challenges of severe weather, aware of the consequences for anyone left out in extreme cold. Jack Lynn, the mission’s president and CEO, said local police informed the shelter that one homeless man died not far from the property in the past week.

“We knew the individual, and it was just a comfort factor, they didn’t want to come into the shelter, so unfortunately, it’s one of the ones from our community we were working with to try and get them in,” he said. 

Mr. Lynn said the mission has been fortunate to renovate its facilities, allowing for 10 additional beds to accommodate overflow. However, space for women remains limited. Like City Mission, plans are also in place to use cots or hotel accommodations when necessary.

Community mealtimes are one way staff encourages people to temporarily seek refuge from the elements. He said street outreach teams have been working to connect with the homeless in remote locations, despite icy and snow-covered terrain making access difficult.

“Sometimes they just need to hear that somebody cares about them enough and wants to see them safe, that they’re worried about them,” Mr. Lynn said. “It just takes that encouragement for them to open up and want to go into a shelter. That’s the big thing.”

The region’s shelters are calling on the community to help by donating winter coats, boots, hats and other cold-weather essentials.

Second Avenue Commons, due to space constraints, cannot accept drop-offs but encourages donors to contact Brendan Copp, the volunteer coordinator at Pittsburgh Mercy, at Brendan.Copp@pittsburghmercy.org or 412-897-8822 to schedule drop-offs.",https://www.post-gazette.com/news/weather-news/2025/01/06/winter-storm-snow-cold-weather/stories/202501060073,real,0
"Punjab CM expresses remorse over deaths of Sheikhupura school students.

LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Bazdar on Tuesday expressed regret over the deaths of three female students in a collision between a train and a school van near Sheikhupura.

"Punjab CM expresses remorse over deaths of Sheikhupura school students.

Sheikhupura, Pakistan – January 12, 2025: Punjab Chief Minister (CM) expressed deep remorse over the tragic deaths of multiple school students in Sheikhupura, terming the incident a “heart-wrenching loss that has left the entire province in mourning.”

The students were killed in a devastating road accident earlier this week when their school van collided with a speeding truck on Sheikhupura Road. The crash, which claimed the lives of 12 children and left several others critically injured, has sparked outrage over the lack of enforcement of traffic safety measures in the region.

The CM, who visited the grieving families in Sheikhupura today, assured them of the government’s full support. “This is an unimaginable tragedy. My thoughts and prayers are with the families who lost their loved ones. We will do everything in our power to ensure that such incidents are not repeated,” he said.

During his visit, the CM announced financial compensation for the victims’ families and free medical treatment for the injured. Each bereaved family will receive PKR 2 million, while the injured students will be provided with PKR 500,000 each.

In addition, the Chief Minister directed the provincial transport and education departments to conduct a thorough review of school transport safety protocols. “We must take immediate steps to ensure the safety of our children. There will be no tolerance for negligence,” he emphasized.

Initial investigations suggest that the truck driver, who fled the scene but was later apprehended, was operating without a valid license. Authorities confirmed that the school van was overcrowded, further compounding the risk.

The tragedy has ignited a broader debate about road safety and the enforcement of traffic laws in Punjab. Advocacy groups have called on the government to address the increasing number of road accidents involving schoolchildren.

In a statement, the Sheikhupura district administration vowed to improve road conditions and increase police patrolling in high-risk areas.

As the province reels from the loss, candlelight vigils and prayers for the departed souls were held across Punjab, with citizens expressing solidarity with the bereaved families.

This heartbreaking incident serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for comprehensive reforms to protect the lives of Pakistan’s youngest citizens.","generate a news article for the following headline: ""Punjab CM expresses remorse over deaths of Sheikhupura school students""",fake,1

"Basketball Game Preview: North Creek Jaguars vs. Bothell/Inglemoor Cougars.

Bothell, WA—December 23, 2024

The North Creek Jaguars and the Bothell/Inglemoor Cougars are set to clash in a highly anticipated basketball showdown this Friday at Bothell High School. Both teams are coming off strong starts to the season and are vying for dominance in the KingCo 4A conference.

North Creek Jaguars: A Rising Power
The Jaguars, led by head coach Amanda Ellis, have demonstrated exceptional teamwork and resilience this season. With a record of 8-2, North Creek is riding high after a decisive 78-64 victory over Skyline last week.

Junior guard Tyler Hampton has been the backbone of the team, averaging 22 points per game while dishing out six assists per contest. His ability to create scoring opportunities and maintain composure under pressure has been a game-changer.

“We’ve been focusing on consistency and execution,” said Coach Ellis during a midweek practice. “The Cougars are tough, but we’re prepared to match their intensity.”

North Creek’s defense has also been stellar, with sophomore forward Mia Rodriguez dominating the boards and blocking an impressive average of four shots per game. Her interior presence will be key against the Cougars’ aggressive offense.

Bothell/Inglemoor Cougars: Home Court Heroes
The Cougars, a hybrid team representing Bothell and Inglemoor, boast a 9-1 record and are undefeated on their home court. Coached by veteran strategist David Chen, the team has been known for its fast-paced offense and precision three-point shooting.

Senior captain Jordan Fields has been a standout, consistently delivering clutch performances. With an average of 25 points and 8 rebounds per game, Fields will be a focal point for the Jaguars' defense.

“North Creek is a talented team, no doubt,” said Coach Chen. “But we thrive on challenges, and the energy from our home crowd always gives us an edge.”

Sophomore sharpshooter Ava Patel is another player to watch. Her 45% shooting from beyond the arc has made her a key offensive weapon, particularly in late-game situations.

Key Matchups to Watch
Tyler Hampton (NC) vs. Jordan Fields (B/I): Both team leaders bring skill and composure to the court, and their head-to-head battle could determine the game’s outcome.
Mia Rodriguez (NC) vs. Cougars’ Frontcourt: Rodriguez’s ability to control the paint will be tested against the Cougars' high-energy forwards.
Ava Patel (B/I) vs. Jaguars Perimeter Defense: North Creek’s ability to shut down Patel’s three-point shooting will be critical in limiting the Cougars' scoring opportunities.

What’s at Stake
This game is more than just another regular-season matchup. Both teams are eyeing the top spot in the KingCo 4A standings, and a win here would provide a significant morale boost heading into the second half of the season.

The Jaguars will aim to maintain their strong momentum, while the Cougars hope to defend their home court and continue their dominance in the league.

"BYD’s fourth-quarter output surpasses Tesla as world’s largest maker of pure electric cars.

In a groundbreaking achievement, Chinese automaker BYD has overtaken Tesla to become the world’s largest producer of pure electric vehicles (EVs) in the fourth quarter of this year. The milestone marks a significant shift in the competitive landscape of the EV market, underscoring BYD’s rapid ascent as a global leader in sustainable transportation.

According to industry data released this week, BYD’s pure EV output for the quarter reached a staggering [insert production number], surpassing Tesla’s [insert production number] for the same period. This achievement is attributed to BYD’s aggressive expansion strategy, diversification of its EV portfolio, and robust performance in key markets, including China and Europe.

A Rapidly Growing Powerhouse

BYD, short for “Build Your Dreams,” has steadily gained momentum in recent years by focusing on affordable EV models and cutting-edge battery technology. The company’s vertically integrated supply chain, which includes in-house battery production, has given it a critical edge in navigating global supply chain challenges.

“This milestone reflects our commitment to accelerating the transition to green mobility,” said [insert BYD executive’s name and title]. “We are proud to offer innovative, high-quality electric vehicles to customers worldwide.”

BYD’s flagship models, such as the [insert model names], have received widespread acclaim for their affordability, range, and advanced features. The company has also launched premium models aimed at competing with Tesla’s higher-end offerings, such as the Model 3 and Model Y.

Tesla Faces Challenges

Meanwhile, Tesla, which has long dominated the EV market, faces mounting challenges, including intensifying competition, production delays, and evolving regulatory environments. While Tesla remains a leader in technological innovation and global brand recognition, analysts suggest that the company may need to adapt its strategy to retain its market position.

“BYD’s rise highlights the growing competition Tesla faces, particularly in China, the world’s largest EV market,” said [insert analyst’s name and title]. “Tesla’s ability to maintain its leadership will depend on how it addresses these challenges and accelerates its expansion into new markets.”

Implications for the Global EV Market

BYD’s triumph signals a broader shift in the global EV market, with Chinese automakers increasingly taking center stage. China’s supportive government policies, investment in EV infrastructure, and strong domestic demand have provided fertile ground for companies like BYD to thrive.

The achievement also underscores the growing importance of affordability in the EV sector. While Tesla’s vehicles are often viewed as premium offerings, BYD’s ability to deliver high-quality, cost-effective alternatives has resonated with a wider range of consumers.

Looking Ahead

As the EV market continues to expand, the rivalry between BYD and Tesla is expected to intensify.

"BYD’s fourth-quarter output surpasses Tesla as world’s largest maker of pure electric cars.

BYD Auto, China’s electric vehicle (EV) king, was the world’s biggest seller of pure electric cars in the fourth quarter of 2024, as Tesla’s sales for the period fell short of expectations.
Shenzhen-based BYD beat Austin, Texas-based Tesla by more than 20 per cent in terms of deliveries. In the fourth quarter, BYD delivered 595,412 battery electric vehicles (BEVs) to customers, up 13.1 per cent from a year earlier. The company, which counts Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway as a shareholder, also sold 918,556 plug-in hybrid cars (PHEVs) in the fourth quarter, up 120.7 per cent from a year earlier.
Elon Musk’s Tesla delivered 495,570 vehicles globally in the fourth quarter, falling short of a consensus forecast of 512,277 vehicles, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Tesla’s deliveries were up 2.3 per cent from a year earlier and 7.1 per cent from the third quarter. All Teslas are BEVs.
“BYD has a strong product line-up whose cheaper BEV models are attractive to more middle- and low-income consumers worldwide,” said Phate Zhang, founder of Shanghai-based electric-car data provider CnEVPost. “It is set to retain the title as the world’s largest BEV maker this year.”

BYD, best known for its cheaper models ranging in price from around 80,000 yuan (US$10,960) to 200,000 yuan, has been a top beneficiary of the breakneck pace of vehicle electrification in China over the past decade. It delivered 4.27 million pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles last year, up 41.3 per cent from a year earlier. It was also expected to surpass Volkswagen (VW) to become the country’s largest carmaker – including EVs and petroleum-powered vehicles – in 2024. VW has yet to release its full-year sales figures.
For the first time ever, Tesla, viewed as an assembler of premium electric cars, reported an annual decline in deliveries. They fell 1.1 per cent from a year earlier to 1.79 million units, the company said. Its New York-listed shares slumped 6 per cent to US$379.28 on Thursday after chalking up a gain of 61 per cent in 2024.

BYD overtook Tesla in terms of deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2023, but the US carmaker regained its crown as the world’s largest seller of BEVs in the first three quarters of 2024.

China is the world’s largest automotive and EV market. The nation’s top players are at the global vanguard of the supply chain because the high-performance batteries and digital technologies used in their in-car entertainment features make it easier for them to assemble better EVs than their international rivals, according to David Xu Daquan, the China president of Bosch, the world’s largest supplier of car parts.

But BYD and its domestic peers are grappling with higher tariffs from the US and the European Union as they try to expand overseas.

“Chinese carmakers still need to learn from Tesla because it is able to design and make cars to cater to consumers in various markets,” said David Zhang, general secretary of the International Intelligent Vehicle Engineering Association. “It is important for them to internationalise their businesses with their advanced technologies and production advantage.”

In the fourth quarter, BYD’s deliveries outside the mainland accounted for just 7.8 per cent of its total. By contrast, Tesla’s sales in China, its second-largest market, made up about 37 per cent of the global total. The company’s Gigafactory in Shanghai delivered 657,000 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to local buyers last year, up 8.8 per cent from 2023.",https://www.scmp.com/business/china-evs/article/3293269/byd-overtakes-tesla-worlds-largest-maker-pure-electric-cars-fourth-quarter,real,0

Department of Public Works crews have been working overtime during the past week treating snow covered roads and that has cut into salt supplies.

A a news conference Friday afternoon, city officials said they have plenty of salt and they dispelled rumors that they’ve run out.

“That is a misinformation, placed out on social media. The city is safe. The city is ready to respond with the proper salt,” the mayor’s office said.

City officials say some rail deliveries this week were delayed by Winter Storm Blair, but they’ve gotten some salt during the past two days and they expect more Saturday and next week.

But they say the recent deliveries are a different type of salt that’s not as effective. It doesn’t work below 17 degrees, but officials says they aren’t worried.

DPW will have about 40 trucks salt trucks out overnight in the city.

Sources inside public works sent photos of two newer rental units went down.

DPW confirmed today there are problems with some rentals.

Pittsburgh, PA – January 12, 2025

As Pittsburgh braces for the harsh winter months, city officials have come under scrutiny following reports of low salt supplies and malfunctioning snow-removal equipment. Concerns have been raised by residents and local council members about the city’s readiness to manage snow and ice, prompting officials to address the situation publicly.

Salt Supply Concerns

Reports emerged earlier this week suggesting that the city’s stockpile of road salt may not be sufficient for the season’s projected snowfall. Public Works Director Emily Carver confirmed that while the current supply is lower than usual, additional salt orders have already been placed and are expected to arrive within the next week.

“We encountered logistical delays with one of our suppliers, which impacted our inventory,” Carver explained. “However, we have secured contracts with alternative vendors to ensure we meet demand throughout the winter.” She also assured residents that priority routes, such as main roads and emergency service pathways, would remain a focus during snowstorms.

Equipment Breakdowns

Adding to the concerns, several snowplows and salt spreaders have reportedly been out of commission due to mechanical issues. According to Carver, aging equipment and increased wear-and-tear from last year’s heavy use have strained the city’s fleet.

“We’ve already begun repairs on the affected vehicles and are expediting maintenance schedules to ensure the fleet is operational,” she said. The city is also considering renting additional equipment from neighboring municipalities if needed.

City Council Reaction

City Council President Marcus Green expressed frustration over the lack of preparedness, stating that these issues highlight a need for better long-term planning. “This is a recurring problem, and our residents deserve better,” Green said. “We need to allocate more resources to preventive maintenance and secure more reliable supply chains.”

Several council members have called for an emergency meeting to discuss the city’s winter weather strategy, with proposals to allocate emergency funds for immediate needs and establish a task force to evaluate infrastructure resilience.

Resident Concerns

Local residents have voiced their dissatisfaction, citing safety concerns and fears of road closures. “It’s not just an inconvenience,” said East Liberty resident Sarah Johnson. “If the roads aren’t treated properly, it’s dangerous for everyone.”

Others have taken to social media to criticize the city’s apparent lack of preparation. Posts on platforms like Twitter and Facebook have been widely shared, with hashtags like #PittsburghSaltShortage trending locally.

Looking Ahead

Mayor James Reynolds has vowed to address the concerns swiftly, stating that the city is “working around the clock” to resolve the issues. “We understand the urgency of this matter and are taking every step to ensure the safety and mobility of our residents this winter,” Reynolds said in a press release.

The mayor’s office has also launched a new hotline for residents to report hazardous road conditions and track snow-removal efforts. Officials hope that increased transparency and communication will alleviate some of the public’s concerns as the city navigates the remainder of the winter season.","Generate a news article with the title: """"""City of Pittsburgh officials address reports of low salt supply, broken winter weather equipment""""""",fake,1

"Mayor Zhou Wei's speech at the closing ceremony of the Fourth Session of the 17th Changzhou Municipal People's Congress.

Dear delegates and comrades:

Today, the congress elected me as the mayor of Changzhou Municipal People's Government. I deeply feel that behind every vote, there is great trust and support from all the delegates, and it carries the earnest expectations and trust of the people of the city.

It is almost a full month since I started working in Changzhou. During this period, I have visited various sectors, investigated some enterprises and related fields. What I see everywhere is the big pattern, big industry, big transportation, big people's livelihood and big ecology of Changzhou's development. Everything reflects the city's characteristics of ""bravely striving for the first-class and ashamed of being second-hand"". What I feel all the time is the good atmosphere of unity and hard work of the four teams, cadres and masses in the city under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee with Secretary Chen Jinhu as the leader. I feel honored and proud to be a part of Changzhou, to contribute to this most outstanding and oldest historical and cultural city and the youngest trillion-dollar city, and to contribute to the happiness and well-being of the people of Longcheng!

At the special moment when the ""14th Five-Year Plan"" and the ""15th Five-Year Plan"" are the continuation of the past and the beginning of the future, and at the critical period of the trillion-dollar city's re-start, I feel that I have a glorious mission and a heavy responsibility to take over the ""baton"" of the mayor. I will always adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, unite and lead the government team under the strong leadership of the provincial party committee, provincial government and municipal party committee, closely rely on the broad masses of cadres and the people in the city, seize the day, work hard, and work hard to write a good answer sheet for the Chinese-style modernization of Changzhou. Here, I solemnly promise:
1. Adhere to loyalty first and be clear-cut about politics. Resolutely take absolute loyalty to the party as the foundation of life, deeply understand the decisive significance of ""two establishments"", and resolutely do ""two maintenances"".

Second, adhere to development as the priority, work diligently and pragmatically. We will firmly grasp the primary task of high-quality development, fully and accurately implement the new development concept, strive to achieve a successful conclusion of the ""14th Five-Year Plan"", and systematically plan and compile the ""15th Five-Year Plan"". We will take multiple measures to boost consumption, expand demand, stabilize investment, and promote the continued recovery of the economy. We will further comprehensively deepen reform, expand high-level opening up, vigorously promote the integrated development of scientific and technological innovation and industrial innovation, and develop new quality productivity according to local conditions. We will continue to improve infrastructure, build a resilient city, promote green transformation, and build a beautiful Changzhou. We will better coordinate development and security, and make every effort to prevent and resolve risks in key areas.

"It Looks Like ‘Half Life 3’ Could Be Announced Very Soon.

A lot of teases and leaks over the holiday period seem to suggest that Half Life 3 could be announced in the coming weeks, or at the very least this year.

While supposed leaks of Half Life 3 are nothing new, a couple have popped up over the last few days that seemingly have a little more credibility than most, with one coming directly from someone you would expect to be involved with the project.

The first signs of movement on the Half Life 3 front came a few days ago when Valve insider Gabe Follower, who has previously correctly reported on Deadlock before it became public, revealed that a build of Half Life 3 was being tested internally at Valve along with friends and family of the developers.

Along with multiple updates that could maybe hint at a new game in the Half Life series but seem somewhat coincidental, Gabe Follower claims to have heard from a source within Valve that a playtest has begun for Half Life 3. These closed playtests are nothing new for Valve, we know they did them for Half Life Alyx and Deadlock long before they were announced, and they were a key factor in the rework of Deadlock’s visual style.

The other big tease that Half Life 3 could be coming soon is that Mike Shapiro, the voice actor for G Man in the Half Life Series, just posted a new video that is seemingly teasing something to do with the franchise. The tweet includes the hashtags #Valve #Halflife #GMan #2025, suggesting that something Half Life related is coming this year.

If this were any other voice actor, then you might think this could just be a coincidence or a new year's message, but Shapiro has been silent on X since the release of Half Life Alyx, so it would certainly be a very random tease out of nowhere if there wasn’t something behind it.

My gut is saying that we can probably expect some news on Half Life 3 at some point in 2025, but a lot could ride on the playtests that are seemingly ongoing. We’ve seen these playtests result in big changes to Valve games in the past, so if things are not going smoothly, it could delay the project even further.

However, what doesn’t seem to be in doubt is that Half Life 3 is clearly being worked on at Valve and there is at least some kind of playable build. Providing said built isn’t terrible, I’d assume we’ll be playing Half Life 3 in the next two or three years at the latest.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2025/01/01/it-looks-like-half-life-3-could-be-announced-very-soon/,real,0
"It Looks Like ‘Half Life 3’ Could Be Announced Very Soon.

The wait for one of the most anticipated games of all time may finally be 
coming to an end. According to a series of leaks and rumors circulating 
online, Valve Corporation, the developer behind the beloved Half-Life 
franchise, is preparing to announce Half-Life 3 in the near future.

Rumors of a potential announcement have been fueled by a recent interview 
with Geoff Keighley, a well-known video game journalist and host of The 
Game Awards, who hinted at a major revelation from Valve during an episode 
of his YouTube series, ""The Final Hours"" (Source: YouTube). When asked 
about the possibility of a Half-Life 3 announcement, Keighley responded, 
""I think it's safe to say that Valve is working on something big, and I'm 
not just talking about Steam Deck or their other projects.""

This statement has sparked widespread speculation among gamers and 
industry insiders, with many pointing to a potential reveal at the 
upcoming E3 2023 conference. In an interview with Game Informer, Tyler 
McVicker, a prominent Valve leaker and owner of the popular YouTube 
channel ""Valve News Network,"" claimed that Valve has been secretly working 
on Half-Life 3 for several years, with a team of over 100 developers 
dedicated to the project (Source: Game Informer).

McVicker also revealed that the game is being developed using Valve's 
proprietary Source 2 engine, which has been in development since 2015. 
This would mark a significant upgrade from the original Source engine used 
in Half-Life 2 and its episodes.

While neither Valve nor its representatives have officially confirmed the 
existence of Half-Life 3, the company's recent hiring spree and expansion 
of its virtual reality (VR) division have led many to speculate that the 
game may incorporate advanced VR features. In an interview with UploadVR, 
Jeremy Selan, a former Valve employee and current VR developer, stated 
that ""Valve is deeply invested in VR and is exploring new ways to 
integrate it into their games"" (Source: UploadVR).

The possibility of a Half-Life 3 announcement has sent shockwaves through 
the gaming community, with fans taking to social media to express their 
excitement and anticipation. On Twitter, #HalfLife3 began trending 
worldwide, with many gamers sharing their favorite memories of playing the 
original Half-Life games.

As the gaming world waits with bated breath for an official announcement 
from Valve, one thing is certain – the hype surrounding Half-Life 3 is 
real, and it's not going away anytime soon. With E3 2023 just around the 
corner, we may finally get our first glimpse of the long-awaited sequel. 
Until then, fans will have to continue speculating and hoping that the 
wait will be worth it.

"SVSEF Alpine skiers open 2025 at Snow King.

Jackson, WY—The Sun Valley Ski Education Foundation (SVSEF) Alpine team kicked off the 2025 ski season in high gear at Snow King Mountain Resort last weekend, bringing both talent and enthusiasm to the slopes. Competing against some of the best young skiers in the region, the SVSEF athletes proved their mettle in a series of thrilling races that marked the official start of the new year in competitive skiing.  

**A Promising Start to the Season**  
The Snow King Mountain venue, known for its challenging courses and stunning views, set the stage for a weekend of exciting competition. With technical giant slalom and slalom races on the schedule, the SVSEF skiers faced tough terrain and fierce opponents, but they rose to the challenge with determination.  

“Our athletes have been training hard all fall, and it’s exciting to see their efforts pay off,” said SVSEF Alpine Director John Smith. “The Snow King races are always a great way to start the season and gauge where we’re at.”  

**Standout Performances**  
The SVSEF team delivered strong results across multiple age groups. Among the standout performers was 16-year-old Lucy Carter, who earned a podium finish in the U16 girls’ giant slalom, placing third.

On the boys’ side, U18 skier Jack Reynolds dominated the slalom event, finishing first in a competitive field. “The course was tough, but I felt really good out there today,” said Reynolds. “It’s awesome to start the season with a win.”  

Other notable finishes included U14 racer Emma Lee, who placed fifth in her division, and U16 skier Ben Thompson, who cracked the top 10 in both giant slalom and slalom events.

"Friday Briefing: Racing to Control Los Angeles Fires.

Firefighters rushed to contain the Los Angeles wildfires

Officials hoped that a drop in wind speeds yesterday would give firefighters a window to take control of the fast-moving blazes that have raged unchecked this week. At least five people have been killed, but that figure is expected to rise. Almost 180,000 people were under evacuation orders. Entire neighborhoods have been destroyed, along with landmarks, making the landscape unrecognizable. Follow our live coverage and our maps of fires.

The Santa Ana winds, dangerous gusts that have spread the flames, were expected to intensify overnight and through the weekend, and possibly continue into next week. Helicopters and planes dropped water from an ominous orange sky, and firefighters battled the blazes with a renewed supply of water after hydrants had gone dry in previous days.

The Hollywood Hills, home to celebrities and entertainment executives, also began to burn overnight. Paris Hilton, Billy Crystal and other celebrities lost their homes.

Twenty people had been arrested and accused of looting during the chaos, with that number expected to increase, law enforcement officials said.

Context: Los Angeles, which is about the same size as two small U.S. states, can be hard to picture. Disasters or riots might occur on one end of the city while those on the opposite end are far removed from the scene. These wildfires, though, have assaulted the metropolis as a whole.

"Cilantro Thai plans to reopen at original location by end of year.

In a delightful turn of events for food enthusiasts and loyal patrons, Cilantro Thai, a beloved local restaurant, has announced plans to reopen at its original location by the end of the year. Known for its authentic Thai cuisine and welcoming atmosphere, the restaurant had been a staple in the community before closing its doors temporarily last year.

The announcement was made earlier this week via the restaurant’s social media platforms, sparking excitement and nostalgia among its followers. “We’ve missed serving our loyal customers and being a part of this amazing community,” the post read. “We’re thrilled to bring back the flavors you love, right where it all began.”

A Journey Back Home
Cilantro Thai initially closed its doors due to unforeseen challenges, including pandemic-related setbacks and supply chain issues. Since then, the owners have been working tirelessly to overcome these obstacles, securing funding and renovating the space to enhance the dining experience.

The reopening comes with a few upgrades. The restaurant promises a revamped menu featuring classic favorites such as Pad Thai and Tom Yum soup, alongside new chef-inspired creations. The owners also hinted at modernized interiors that blend contemporary aesthetics with traditional Thai elements, aiming to create a space that feels both fresh and familiar.

Community Buzz
News of the reopening has been met with widespread enthusiasm. Longtime patron Sarah Jennings expressed her excitement, saying, “Cilantro Thai has always been my go-to spot for authentic Thai food. It’s like welcoming an old friend back home.”

Local businesses are also looking forward to the return, as Cilantro Thai’s presence had always been a draw for foot traffic in the area. “We’re thrilled to have them back,” said Tom Lopez, owner of a nearby bookstore. “It’s a win-win for the community.”

Looking Ahead
The reopening is scheduled for late December, with the exact date to be announced in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the restaurant’s management has encouraged patrons to follow their social media pages for updates, sneak peeks of the menu, and exclusive reopening promotions.

For many, Cilantro Thai’s return symbolizes resilience and the enduring power of community support. As the end of the year approaches, locals are eager to celebrate the holidays with the warm, spicy flavors of their favorite Thai dishes, served in the spot where countless memories were made.

"Cilantro Thai plans to reopen at original location by end of year.

MARION – Cilantro Thai in Marion expects to be able to re-open at its original location by the end of this year, said the owner, Varut Phimolmas.

It’s been an uphill battle for the family that owns and operates the popular Thai restaurant in Marion ever since the location was damaged in an apartment fire last October. 

The fire began in the apartment directly above Cilantro Thai at 374 Front St. No one was injured, but the restaurant, which occupies the first floor of the building, sustained some smoke and water damage, forcing it to close.

The community rallied to support the local restaurant, starting a GoFundMe that has now raised almost $19,000 to assist the restaurant and family with their financial difficulties following the incident, including the possibility of relocation.

At the time, Phimolmas said that they were looking for places to move the business in order to open sooner, and that they might have found one. They began to inquire about the location of the old Marion Sport Shop at 290 Front Street, which is owned by Frank Fletcher. 

Fletcher was willing to work with the Phimolmas family, but the location was designated as a retail space. They had to go before the zoning board to designate it for restaurant business by way of public hearing, which took place on May 26. 

This raised several concerns from neighbors about the parking, volume, hours of operation and limitations regarding the property’s location in the flood zone. 

Richard and Janet Barnes of 296 Front St. wrote a letter to the zoning board regarding their opposition.

The letter quoted a town bylaw that states that a zoning change “may not be substantially more detrimental” than the existing use.

“We believe that the detrimental impacts of increased traffic and congestion at this location on Front Street, adjacent to Tabor Academy, Veterans Memorial Park and the public boat ramp, as well as noise and odors impacting the peaceful enjoyment of the neighbors’ properties, is more than sufficient to deny this request,” the letter said.

It was also noted that even if the zoning change were to occur, there was no written guarantee that Cilantro Thai would be the restaurant that moved in there. 

Other Marion residents signed and sent in a petition, requesting the approval of the zoning change.

“It’s real, authentic Thai food you can’t get anywhere else in the area. Varut and his family are incredible, wonderful community members and we miss their delicious food,” the petition said.

“We never expected to have this kind of situation,” said Phimolmas. “We need to find somewhere to get back to our business as soon as possible.”

Cynthia Callow, a member of the zoning board, stated that even if they approved the zoning change, there would be other hoops for Phimolmas to jump through regarding conservation.

“It would be a great thing for everyone if you went back to your old location,” said Callow. “We don’t want you to leave the town, we don’t want to see [your business] in Mattapoisett or Rochester or any place else.” 

Phimolmas said then that he would soon meet with their previous landlord, Dr. Chuong Pham, and that would determine whether they could move back to the old location.

The board put the hearing on hold until further notice, and following the meeting, Phimolmas reached out to residents through a Facebook post to let them know that they had permission from Pham to move back to their previous location at 374 Front St. upon the completion of repairs.

"Oristano, a war device among the university books: alarm returned.

Oristano, Sardinia – Students and staff at a university library in Oristano faced an unusual and alarming situation earlier today when a war-era device was discovered among a collection of donated books.

The object, initially suspected to be an explosive from World War II, was unearthed by a librarian cataloging materials recently acquired from an estate sale. The device, resembling an old grenade, was nestled between history and engineering textbooks, sparking immediate concern.

Swift Response by Authorities
Upon discovering the suspicious item, library staff promptly evacuated the building and contacted local law enforcement. Police, accompanied by bomb disposal experts from the Carabinieri, arrived on the scene within minutes.

“The safety of everyone present was our top priority,” said Police Captain Marco Rossi. “We treated the situation with the utmost seriousness until experts could confirm the nature of the device.”

Students and faculty gathered outside the building, some visibly shaken, while others speculated on how such an object ended up in a university setting.

A Harmless Relic
After a careful examination, bomb disposal experts determined that the device was a deactivated relic from the early 20th century. According to officials, it posed no threat to public safety.

“It appears to have been an inert training model or a collector’s item,” explained Colonel Stefano Bianchi of the Oristano Carabinieri. “There was no active explosive material inside, and it had likely been rendered harmless decades ago.”

Back to Normal
With the all-clear given, the university reopened the library later in the afternoon. Many students expressed relief but also lingering curiosity about the unusual find.

“This is something you’d expect to hear about in a novel, not experience firsthand,” remarked Giulia, a history major who was present during the evacuation. “It’s a strange reminder of how history can resurface in unexpected ways.”

University officials announced plans to review their protocols for handling donated materials and to work closely with authorities in the future to ensure no similar incidents occur.

A Piece of History
The inert device has been handed over to a local museum for further study and potential display as part of a collection on Sardinia’s wartime history. Experts believe it might provide insights into military training methods during the early 1900s.

While the incident disrupted the day for many at the university, it also offered a unique opportunity to reflect on the region's historical legacy.","What would a news article with the title 'Oristano, a war device among the university books: alarm returned' look like?

"AcDec Team Goes to State Competition.

While most of the school’s students spend Spring Break watching television or putting off homework, nine of this school’s students spend their time studying and competing at the California Academic Decathlon competition in Sacramento. During a three week competition that involved the top schools in California (and in the nation), the school’s AcDec team garnered several medals, raised its overall score by over 3,000 points (from approximately 45,000 at Regionals to 48,000), and finished in 16th place among 65 schools.

Joy Gu, a senior on Team 1, described the experience:

“By far,” she said, “the highlight of my senior [year] has been the incredible weekend of the state competition. It was definitely a different atmosphere competing with some of the brightest kids in California, but the whole experience was surreal and exhilarating. The SuperQuiz event was my favorite; it was an incredible feeling to walk in knowing we were now a part of Casa’s AcDec history.”

The school’s AcDec team collectively won medals in speech, interview, art, and social science. Gu’s favorite part of the competition, though, was the opportunity to grow as friends in the midst of the competition.

“We started this weekend as teammates,” Gu said, “and ended as best friends. Since the competition was so intense, every medal was a victory.”

Junior Dominik Martinez cooloquially agreed that the competition was difficult but offered an opportunity to grow as friends.

“The nine of us…. work really hard together and develop good friendships with each other. We then take all this preparation to compete against other schools that have literally worked so hard that they have formed into one large Asian mass of human.”

The winner of the state competition was a Los Angeles charter school, El Camino Real; the team took the gold with 57, 747.3 points.

"Manuel Antonio Barrios, the young escort who died after confronting criminals in Valledupar.

Valledupar, Colombia – A tragic incident unfolded in the heart of Valledupar when Manuel Antonio Barrios, a young escort dedicated to public safety, lost his life in a brave confrontation with criminals. The incident has left the community mourning and brought renewed attention to the dangers faced by security personnel in the region.

A Brave Young Man

Manuel Antonio Barrios, just 25 years old, had recently joined a private security firm in Valledupar. Known for his commitment and courage, Barrios had dreams of contributing to his community’s safety and was often described as a dependable and cheerful individual by those who knew him.

“Manuel was a young man full of life, always willing to help others. He believed in justice and wasn’t afraid to stand up for what was right,” said a close friend, visibly shaken by the news.

The Fateful Incident

The confrontation occurred late Friday evening in a busy neighborhood of Valledupar. According to eyewitnesses, Barrios was escorting a high-value delivery when he noticed suspicious individuals attempting to intercept the cargo. Despite being outnumbered, Barrios confronted the assailants, engaging in a heated struggle to protect the delivery and its personnel.

Authorities report that Barrios’ quick thinking prevented the criminals from achieving their goal. However, in the ensuing clash, he sustained fatal injuries and succumbed to them before emergency services could arrive.

“His actions undoubtedly thwarted a significant crime, but it came at a heartbreaking cost,” stated Captain Jorge Mendoza of the Valledupar Police Department. “His bravery will not be forgotten.”

Community Reaction

News of Barrios’ death has sent shockwaves through Valledupar. Residents gathered at the site of the incident to pay their respects, leaving flowers and lighting candles in his honor. Social media has also been flooded with tributes, with many calling for greater support and protection for security personnel.

Local leaders have urged authorities to expedite the investigation and bring those responsible to justice. “Manuel’s sacrifice must not go in vain. We need stricter measures to ensure the safety of those who risk their lives for our community,” said councilmember Luisa Fernanda Muñoz.

An Urgent Call for Action

The tragedy has reignited discussions about the challenges faced by private security escorts, including inadequate training, limited resources, and the ever-present risks of confronting organized crime. Experts emphasize the need for comprehensive reforms to address these issues and prevent future losses.

“The role of security personnel is critical in maintaining order, but they often operate under difficult conditions. Investments in training and better equipment are essential,” noted criminologist Rafael Pérez.

Honoring a Hero

As Valledupar mourns, plans are underway for a public memorial to honor Manuel Antonio Barrios. His family has expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support and called on the community to remember him as a hero who gave his life protecting others.

“Manuel’s bravery and selflessness will forever be etched in our hearts,” said his mother, Maria Fernanda Barrios. “He was more than a son; he was a protector, a dreamer, and a symbol of hope.”

The investigation into the incident continues, with authorities pledging to leave no stone unturned in their pursuit of justice for Manuel Antonio Barrios. In the meantime, his story serves as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by those who work tirelessly to safeguard their communities.","Generate a news article with the title:

"Climate Ready: Innovative system helping local college campus become carbon neutral.

January 13, 2025

In a bold step toward sustainability, Green Valley College (GVC) has unveiled a cutting-edge system designed to help the campus achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. The innovative approach combines renewable energy technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), and campus-wide participation, setting a new benchmark for higher education institutions worldwide.

The centerpiece of the system is a hybrid solar and wind microgrid, which supplies over 80% of the campus’s energy needs. Built with efficiency and scalability in mind, the microgrid uses AI to monitor energy demand, optimize storage, and predict fluctuations in supply based on weather patterns.

“Climate action isn’t just a goal; it’s a responsibility,” said Dr. Elaine Morris, Director of Sustainability at GVC. “With this system, we’re not only reducing our carbon footprint but also empowering students and faculty to be part of the solution.”

Key Innovations

One of the most striking features of GVC’s initiative is its integration of AI-powered sensors throughout the campus. These sensors track energy use in real-time, allowing for precise adjustments and eliminating waste. Additionally, buildings have been retrofitted with smart thermostats and LED lighting, reducing overall energy consumption by 30%.

The college has also invested heavily in bio-based carbon capture. Small-scale systems placed around the campus extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it underground. The process is complemented by a green landscaping strategy, including rooftop gardens and expanded tree coverage, which naturally sequester carbon.

To encourage community involvement, GVC has introduced a student-focused app called “Climate Ready.” The app gamifies sustainable actions, such as using public transportation, reducing waste, and conserving electricity. Participants earn points that can be exchanged for rewards, such as meal vouchers or event tickets.

Transforming Education

As part of the initiative, sustainability is now embedded into GVC’s curriculum across all disciplines. Engineering students are designing solar-powered charging stations, while business majors are developing financial models to scale similar systems globally. Faculty members are also using the campus as a living lab, publishing research on renewable energy and climate resilience.

“This isn’t just about achieving neutrality—it’s about transforming how we live, learn, and think about our planet,” said Professor Miguel Torres, a leading climate researcher at GVC.

Looking Ahead

With early successes already evident, GVC is inspiring other institutions to follow suit. Their carbon-neutral system is not only cutting emissions but also saving the college an estimated $1.2 million annually in energy costs. Plans are underway to share the technology with local communities, further amplifying its impact.

As the effects of climate change continue to intensify, Green Valley College’s innovative efforts prove that action at the local level can yield significant, global results. Through leadership, technology, and community engagement, the campus is paving the way for a sustainable future.

For GVC and its supporters, the message is clear: climate readiness is not just possible—it’s happening now.",Write a real news article with the title Climate Ready: Innovative system helping local college campus become carbon neutral,fake,1

Students returning to class at Swarthmore College may not realize it, but they're part of a big change.

The college has a huge environmental goal that it's a lot closer to reaching thanks to what's beneath the campus, especially beneath the Swarthmore College Dining Center.

""It's the heart of our carbon-free energy system on campus,"" said Andrew Feick, Associate Vice President of Sustainable Facilities Operations and Capital Planning at Swarthmore College.

Through the door next to the assortment of desserts at the dining hall, a set of stairs leads to a room that will eventually help power nearly the entire campus without a drop of fossil fuel.

""In this plant is where we have our heat recovery chillers which are right next to me,"" said Feick as he stood in the geo-exchange plant housed in the basement of the dining center.

""Carbon neutrality really means either eliminating or in some way neutralizing all of your greenhouse gas emission,"" said Elizabeth Drake, Director of Sustainability at Swarthmore College.

The geo-exchange plant beneath the dining center is connected to a three-and-a-half acre field on campus, or really what's underneath that field.

""You look at it right now, it's hard to imagine that it's got 350 wells underneath it that go 800 feet down into the ground,"" said Feick.

It's for a process known as geo-exchange. Here's how it works: the heat that's removed from buildings is stored underground. The liquid in the wells helps transfer it back to the buildings to heat them in the winter and cool them in the summer.

""The whole system will be powered by renewable electricity which is what will helps us achieve carbon neutrality,"" said Drake.

Crews dug up the three-and-a-half-acre field In 2022. Swarthmore invested $125 million into changing its old steam energy system into a geo-exchange that will eventually save the college money on energy.

Steven Mukum, a Junior in Global Studies and Economics at Swarthmore College, says he's impressed by all of the efforts that the school has put forth to be carbon neutral.

""It's important to me. I think it's important to a lot of people on campus,"" she said.

Carbon neutrality is also increasingly important to colleges. The 6abc Data Team found that 355 U.S. colleges and universities have committed to reaching net-zero emissions by a particular date.

""We'll be connecting the first set of buildings this fall,"" said Drake. ""Actually what we're calling flip the switch this fall to start heating and cooling buildings using geo-exchange for the first time.""

The innovative system will eventually power the majority of buildings on campus including the dining center, which was also built with carbon neutrality in mind.

""It's mass timber instead of using steel... it's much less carbon-intensive than steel,"" said Feick.

So whether students in the dining hall are impressed by the energy source or the entrees, Swarthmore College is well on its way to becoming a carbon-free campus.

""I really think it's a wonderful endeavor,"" said Mukum.

Next year, Swarthmore College will work on installing 350 more wells as part of that geo-exchange. It's something they'll build on over the next ten years, as they work to become carbon neutral.

"Pennsylvania American Water shuts down portion of road after massive water main break in Baldwin.

Baldwin, PA — January 11, 2025 — Pennsylvania American Water has been forced to shut down a portion of a major road in Baldwin following a massive water main break earlier this morning. The incident, which occurred near the intersection of Streets Run Road and Curry Hollow Road, caused significant flooding, leaving nearby streets and properties submerged in water.

Emergency crews were dispatched to the scene shortly after the break was reported. The water main, which officials believe is an older part of the infrastructure, ruptured around 5:30 AM, sending thousands of gallons of water gushing into the surrounding area. Residents reported hearing a loud rumble, followed by rising water levels that quickly inundated the roadway.

""We are actively working to repair the damaged pipe and assess the extent of the damage caused by this break,"" said a representative from Pennsylvania American Water. ""Our primary concern is restoring service to affected customers as quickly as possible.""

Local authorities have closed the affected section of the road and advised drivers to avoid the area while repair work is underway. Detours have been set up to redirect traffic, and residents are being urged to exercise caution due to potentially slippery conditions caused by water and debris.

Several homes and businesses in the area are experiencing reduced water pressure or complete outages. Pennsylvania American Water has set up temporary water distribution stations for residents who are without water, and they are working around the clock to fix the issue.

""We understand the inconvenience this has caused for our customers and the community,"" the company said in a statement. ""We are doing everything we can to expedite repairs, but safety remains our top priority.""

At this time, it is unclear how long the repairs will take or when full water service will be restored. Local officials are monitoring the situation closely and have urged residents to stay informed through local news updates.

For real-time information on the repair progress and detours, Pennsylvania American Water has advised residents to check their website and social media channels.",generate a news with title Pennsylvania American Water shuts down portion of road after massive water main break in Baldwin,fake,1
"Speed Camera Citations to be Enforced in Hopewell City School Zones.

**Speed Camera Citations to be Enforced in Hopewell City School Zones**

Hopewell City residents should be prepared to slow down while driving through school zones as new speed camera enforcement measures will soon take effect. The initiative, which was announced by city officials at a press conference on Monday, is aimed at improving pedestrian safety and reducing speeding violations in areas frequented by children.

The new speed cameras, installed at five school zones across the city, will become operational starting February 1. These zones include Hopewell Elementary, Riverside Middle School, and three other high-traffic school areas identified as having significant speeding issues during peak hours.

“Our priority is the safety of our students and families,” said Mayor Laura Whitman. “Data has shown that speeding is a major concern near schools, and these cameras will act as a deterrent while also holding drivers accountable for unsafe behavior.”

The cameras will monitor vehicle speeds during school hours, which run from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on weekdays. Drivers caught exceeding the posted speed limit by 10 miles per hour or more will automatically receive a citation in the mail. First-time offenders will face a $50 fine, while repeat violations could result in higher penalties.

Hopewell City Police Chief Marcus Herrera highlighted the importance of compliance. “Our goal isn’t to issue tickets; it’s to encourage safe driving habits. We’re giving residents ample notice to adjust their behavior before enforcement begins.”

City officials have already placed warning signs near the selected school zones to alert drivers about the upcoming changes. Additionally, there will be a two-week grace period once the cameras go live, during which only warning notices will be issued.

Parents and school administrators have expressed strong support for the initiative. Sarah Mendoza, a parent at Hopewell Elementary, said, “It’s about time something was done. I’ve seen too many close calls when picking up my kids.”

However, not all residents are in favor of the program. Some have raised concerns about privacy and the potential for the cameras to disproportionately affect low-income drivers. “The fines might seem small, but for some families, they’re a big burden,” said local activist David Harper.

In response to these concerns, the city has partnered with a nonprofit organization to provide educational resources and promote safe driving awareness campaigns. Officials have also announced a hardship program that will allow eligible drivers to appeal or reduce fines based on financial need.

Hopewell City’s decision aligns with a growing trend nationwide to enhance traffic safety through automated enforcement. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, cities that implemented speed cameras saw a 20-40% reduction in speeding violations within the first year.

“We’re optimistic that this program will create a safer environment for everyone,” said Mayor Whitman. “When it comes to our children’s safety, every measure counts.”

Residents with questions about the program are encouraged to attend a public information session scheduled for January 25 at City Hall. Further details can also be found on the city’s website.

"Speed Camera Citations to be Enforced in Hopewell City School Zones.

Citations will now be enforced where speed cameras are placed in Hopewell City school zones should the posted speed limit be exceeded by 10 miles per hour. This effort is part of the ‘School Zone Enforcement Program,’ under the city’s public safety efforts.

A citation of $100 will be given to the registered vehicle owner, meaning should someone else be driving the car, the owner will be responsible for paying the bill. Speed cameras are posted on the northbound and southbound lanes near Carter G. Woodson Middle School (Winston Churchill Drive), Harry E. James Elementary School (Arlington Road), and Hopewell High School (Mesa Drive).

No points will be added to the driver’s driving record, nor will it appear on their driving history. Citations may be contested within 30 days of its issuance either by mail or in person. If no response is received, the vehicle owner will lose the right to an appeal.

"New Year Begins with Bustling Activity at Shanghai Yangshan Port.

Shanghai Observer News
January 10, 2025, 22:53

On January 9, 2025, all berths at the Shanghai Yangshan Port terminal were fully occupied, with large container ships entering and exiting the port in an orderly manner.

As the new year begins, Shanghai Yangshan Port is bustling with activity. In 2024, the container throughput exceeded 26 million TEUs (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units), setting a new historical record. This represents a year-on-year growth of approximately 4% and accounts for more than half of Shanghai Port's total throughput. This remarkable achievement has strongly supported Shanghai Port in becoming the first container port in the world to surpass an annual throughput of 50 million TEUs.

Statistics show that as of December 22, the number of international sailing vessels entering and exiting Yangshan Port reached over 9,860, a 5% increase compared to the same period last year. This reflects Yangshan Port's significant role in international shipping and its busy operational status. Through innovative regulatory measures like the ""Smart Customs"" system, Yangshan Port has improved regulatory efficiency and hardware capabilities, significantly reducing the time ships spend at the port. This, in turn, has effectively lowered operating costs for shipping companies.

"Far From the Fires, the Deadly Risks of Smoke Are Intensifying.

As wildfires rage across the country, a growing concern is emerging for those miles away from the flames. Experts warn that wildfire smoke, laden with hazardous fine particulate matter, is becoming an escalating health risk for millions.

Studies show that wildfire smoke can travel hundreds, even thousands, of miles, carrying microscopic particles called PM2.5 that penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream. These particles are linked to respiratory illnesses, heart disease, and even premature death. Vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and those with preexisting health conditions, are particularly at risk.

This year, cities far removed from wildfires, including those in the Midwest and East Coast, have reported days of unhealthy air quality. Public health officials urge people to take precautions such as staying indoors, using air purifiers, and wearing N95 masks when air quality declines.

The situation underscores the far-reaching impacts of climate change, which is intensifying wildfire activity. “Smoke exposure is no longer just a local issue; it’s a national public health crisis,” said Dr. Emily Carter, a leading researcher in environmental health.

As wildfire seasons grow longer and more severe, experts call for urgent action to address the root causes and invest in strategies to protect communities from the unseen, but deadly, consequences of smoke.","News Article Title: ""Far From the Fires, the Deadly Risks of Smoke Are Intensifying""

"Far From the Fires, the Deadly Risks of Smoke Are Intensifying.

It kills more people each year than car crashes, war or drugs do. This invisible killer is the air pollution from sources like cars and trucks or factory smokestacks.

But as wildfires intensify and grow more frequent in a warming world, the smoke from these fires is emerging as a new and deadly pollution source, health experts say. By some estimates, wildfire smoke — which contains a mixture of hazardous air pollutants like particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and lead — already causes as many as 675,000 premature deaths a year worldwide, as well as a range of respiratory, heart and other diseases.

Research shows that wildfire smoke is starting to erode the world’s progress in cleaning up pollution from tailpipes and smokestacks, as climate change supercharges fires.

“It’s heartbreaking, it really is,” said Dr. Afif El-Hasan, a pediatrician who specializes in asthma care at Kaiser Permanente in Southern California and a board director of the American Lung Association. Wildfires “are putting our homes in danger, but they’re also putting our health in danger,” Dr. El-Hasan said, “and it’s only going to get worse.”

Those health concerns were coming to the fore this week as wildfires ravaged the Los Angeles area. Residents began to return to their neighborhoods, many strewed with smoldering ash and rubble, to survey the damage. Air pollution levels remained high in many parts of the city, including in northwest coastal Los Angeles, where the air quality index climbed to “dangerous” levels.

Los Angeles, in particular, has seen air pollution at levels that could be raising daily mortality by between 5 to 15 percent, said Carlos F. Gold, an expert in the health effects of air pollution at the University of California, San Diego.

That means current death counts, “while tragic, are likely large underestimates,” he said. People with underlying health issues, as well as older people and children, are particularly vulnerable.

The rapid spread of this week’s fires into dense neighborhoods, where they burned homes, furniture, cars, electronics and materials like paint and plastic, made the smoke more dangerous, said Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician in the San Francisco Bay Area and the executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health.

A recent study found that even for homes that are spared destruction, smoke and ash blown inside could adhere to rugs, sofas and drywall, creating health hazards that can linger for months. “We’re breathing in this toxic brew of volatile organic compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and hexavalent chromium,” Dr. Patel said. “All of it is noxious.”

Intensifying and more frequent fires, meanwhile, are upending experts’ understanding of smoke’s health effects. “Wildfire season is no longer a season,” said Colleen Reid, who researches the effects of air pollution from wildfires on heath at the University of Colorado Boulder. “We have fires all year round that affect the same population repeatedly.”

“The health impacts are not the same as if you were exposed once, and then not again for 10 years,” she said. “The effects of that is something that we still don’t really know.”

A United Nations report from 2022 concluded that the risk of devastating wildfires around the world would surge in coming decades. Heating and drying caused by climate change, along with development in places vulnerable to fire, was expected to intensify a “global wildfire crisis,” the report said. Both the frequency and intensity of extreme wildfires have more than doubled in the past two decades. In the United States, the average acreage burned a year has surged since the 1990s.

Now, pollution from wildfires is reversing what had been a decades-long improvement in air quality brought about by cleaner cars and power generation. Since at least 2016, in nearly three-quarters of states in the U.S. mainland, wildfire smoke has eroded about 25 percent of progress in reducing concentrations of a type of particulate matter called PM 2.5, a Nature study in 2023 found.

In California, wildfire smoke’s effect on air quality is offsetting public health gains brought about by a decline in air pollution from automobiles and factories, state health officials have found. (By releasing carbon dioxide and other planet-warming gases into the atmosphere, wildfires are themselves a big contributor to climate change: The wildfires that ravaged Canada’s boreal forests in 2023 produced more greenhouse gases than the burning of fossil fuels in all but three countries.)

”It’s not a pretty picture,” said Dr. Gold of U.C. San Diego, who took part in the Nature study. If planet-warming gas emissions continue at current levels, “we’ve got some work that suggests that mortality from wildfire smoke in the U.S. could go up by 50 percent,” he said.

One silver lining is that the Santa Ana winds that so ferociously fueled the flames in recent days have been blowing some of the smoke toward the ocean. That stands in contrast to the smoke from the 2023 Canadian wildfires that drifted to New York and other American states hundreds of miles away, causing spikes in emergency room visits for asthma.

At one point that year, more than a third of Americans, from the East Coast to the Midwest, were under air quality alerts from Canadian wildfire smoke. “We’re seeing new and worsening threats in places that are not used to them,” Dr. Patel, the pediatrician, said.

The new normal is bringing about changes to health care, Dr. Patel said. More health systems are sending out air quality alerts to vulnerable patients. In the small community hospital where she works, “every child that comes in with wheezing or asthma, I talk to them about how air pollution is getting worse because of wildfires and climate change,” she said.

“I teach them how to look up air quality, and say they should ask for an air purifier,” Dr. Patel added. She also cautions that children should not participate in cleanup after a wildfire.

Scientists are still trying to understand the full range of wildfire smoke’s health effects. One big question is how much of what researchers know about vehicle exhaust and other forms of air pollution apply to wildfire smoke, said Mark R. Miller, a researcher at the Center for Cardiovascular Science at the University of Edinburgh who led a recent global survey of climate change, air pollution and wildfires.

For example, exhaust particles “are so small that when we breathe them in, they go deep down into our lungs and are actually small enough that they can pass from our lungs into our blood,” he said. “And once they’re in our blood, they can be carried around our body and start to build up.”

That means air pollution affects our entire body, he said. “It has effects on people who have diabetes, has effects on the liver and the kidney, it has effects on the brain, on pregnancy,” he said. What’s still not clear is whether pollution from wildfires has all of those same effects. “But it’s likely,” he said.

Experts have a range of advice for people living in areas with smoke. Keep an eye on air quality alerts, and follow evacuation orders. Stay indoors as much as possible, and use air purifiers. When venturing outside, wear N95 masks. Don’t do strenuous exercise in bad air. Keep children, older people and other vulnerable groups away from the worst smoke.

Ultimately, tackling climate change and cutting back on all kinds of air pollution is the way to reduce the overall burden on health, said Dr. El-Hasan of the American Lung Association. “Can you imagine how much worse things would be if we hadn’t started cleaning up emissions from our cars?” he said. “I’m trying to think, glass half full, but it does break my heart and it does worry me.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/climate/wildfire-smoke-risks.html,real,0
"Wangfujing will introduce 45 first-store flagship stores this year.

This newspaper (Reporter Li Yao) Wangfujing Business District's first-store effects such as first release, first show, and first exhibition are gathering at a high energy level.

"“Ground-truthing” underway on Butterfield Overland National Trail.

After a feasibility study conducted some 20 years ago, the 1858 Butterfield Overland Mail Route was designated a National Historic Trail (NHT) by the U.S. National Park Service (NPS) on Jan. 5, 2023.

The NPS is now performing boots-on-the-ground scouting of the trail’s historic 3,292-mile route, some 40 miles of which pass through Barry County, north to south.

Angelica Sanchez-Clark, with the Historic Trails Office of the NPS, calls her office’s reconnaissance mission “Groundtruthing,” Members of her team, based in Santa Fe, N.M., passed through Barry County the second week in November, making only a brief pit-stop in Cassville. However, Sanchez-Clark said she hopes to meet with city, county and state planners, as well as private property owners, located along the historic trail in the near future.

“We’re working on a plan for the development of the Butterfield NHT,” Sanchez-Clark said. “We want to encourage city planners and private property owners to think about the historic trail in their backyards, and present them with information about ways they can partner with the NPS to preserve and promote their section of the national trail.”

The Butterfield’s route through the center of Cassville – and its overlap with the infamous “Cherokee Trail of Tears” and the Civil War’s Telegraph Road, known locally as “The Old Wire Road” — puts the city in a prime position to take advantage of the NPS’s promotional assistance.

Visible remnants of the original trail are of particular importance to the NPS, said Sanchez-Clark. Aside from segments in national parks, such as in Wilson’s Creek and at Pea Ridge National Battlefield, most visible remnants of the trail exist on private property.

A trail segment is clearly visible from the public farm road (on gated private property), about a half-mile northeast of Madry Christian Union Church on Highway 39, in eastern Barry County.

According to Barry County history, Civil War troops forded Flat Creek a total of 13 times en route from McDowell to Cassville, so it’s likely that intact remnants of the trail still exist on private properties alongside the creek. Such remnants are part of local – and now national – history.

“The plan is to present a vision for how the public can interact with the remnants and stories of the trail and [learn] the important role [the trail] played in American history,” the NPS’s website said (https://tinyurl.com/ czwv23tv).

Sanchez-Clark said it’s important to her office, which oversees 10 national trails, to be historically accurate when developing the Butterfield trail. With that in mind, the NPS has contracted with Logan-Simpson Environmental Services to conduct Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) research of the trail’s 3,000-plus miles. With the relatively new laser LIDAR technology, impressions in the earth — including wagon wheel swales — can be detected.

Sanchez-Clark emphasizes that the NPS operates solely in an administrative capacity.

“We don’t manage anybody’s land, nor do we own any of the land along the trail,” she said.

Partnership with the NPS doesn’t obligate any landowner to follow the suggestions presented in the development plan, the NPS’s website said.

“We’re just available for free technical support for promotion and, possibly, financial support for preservation,” Sanchez-Clark said.

Sites must first be certified as being worthy of interest, the NPS’s website said. Partnership with the NPS, Sanchez-Clark said, involves the ability of the NPS to provide resources, including funding for preservation, signage at no charge, and trail-marker listings on the NPS website for parties interested in partnering.

Signage can include a single sign, directive signs or wayside interpretive display markers.

John Butterfield’s ambitious 3,292-mile overland mail route was originally approved by the federal government in 1857 and began operation in 1858. Favored for its sweeping “ox-bow curve” through seven southern states, which steered clear of high mountain passes, Butterfield’s original mail route ran for only three short years before the Civil War curtailed its operation.

The Butterfield Overland Mail Route — newly designated as the “Butterfield Overland NHT” — began its land route in Tipton and terminated in San Francisco, Calif.

From Tipton, in Missouri, the route meandered mostly south and a bit to the west, where it passed through Springfield, then continued southwesterly through bits of Christian and Stone Counties, before descending through Barry County.

The Butterfield route entered Barry County at its northeast corner, near the small community of Osa. The mail coach made its first stop in the county just a couple of miles to the southwest of Osa, at Smith Station, situated beside Wise Spring.

The historical aspect of Smith Station is commemorated, there, and the area around the spring is maintained like a park by the property-owner, who values privacy.

From Smith Station, the Butterfield mail coach traveled several more miles to the southwest, before making a second stop at Crouch Station, located alongside Flat Creek, about four miles northeast of Cassville. It’s difficult to spot, but the original 1858 Butterfield concrete marker is intact in the vicinity of Crouch Station. However, the actual location of the station, now long gone, was in question by the NPS team and their local guide, retired medical Dr. John Fahey, of Fayetteville, Ark., a member of the Butterfield Overland Trail Association.

Rick Boyer, of Virginia, who stopped by the office of the Cassville Democrat last December after reading the article “Scouting out The Trail” (https:// tinyurl.com/2ujp7r4v) in Through the Years Magazine – solved the mystery.

“I was born in the old Crouch Station house in 1952,” Boyer said. “The house was located across the road to the southeast from where the marker is located.”

His mother, Louise Leitner – of Wichita, Kan., formerly of Cassville – confirmed Boyer’s statement.

Confirmation also comes from railroad retiree and investigative cartographer Greg Wadley, of Springfield, who uses research from the United States Geological Survey’s (USGS’s) LIDAR to trace the Butterfield’s route through Missouri, and to then create maps based on his findings.

“The LIDAR showed evidence of the footings of a house across the road from the Crouch Station marker,” Wadley said.

Wadley provided preliminary Barry County trail information to Dr. Fahey, who served as the NPS’s tour guide during their November visit.

Local property owners, however, often know more about their properties’ history than what can be discovered by new technology. A mile south of Washburn, Jerry Ellis owns the site where Barry County’s third, final and southern-most Butterfield stage stop, Harbin Station, was located.

Ellis’ mother, Roberta Ellis, was a descendent of the Harbins, according to armchair historian, blogger and Butterfield trail-scouter Don Matt, of Berryville, Ark. Matt visited with Mrs. Ellis in person several years before her death a couple of years ago. Her son, who now owns the property where Harbin Station once stood, values privacy in the same manner as the Smith Station property owner.

“That’s okay,” said Angelica Sanchez-Clark. “The park service has different ways of partnering with private landowners. We respect property owners’ desire for privacy. We don’t go where we’re not welcome, nor do we put up signs without permission.”

However, Sanchez-Clark said an alternative to the posting of signs and interpretive wayside markers, might be the hosting of occasional public viewings of station sites – maybe once a year, for example — as a way of preserving history, and to give history buffs a peek into the past.

“I will be in Fayetteville, Ark., Dec. 16-19, to visit with Northwest Arkansas city planners about partnering with the NPS,” Sanchez-Clark said. “I hope to schedule a trip to another area afterward.”

Cassville, she said, is an area of interest.

"“Ground-truthing” underway on Butterfield Overland National Trail.

The Butterfield Overland National Trail, a historic route renowned for its role in westward expansion and early American mail service, is undergoing a process known as ""ground-truthing"" to ensure its accurate preservation and interpretation. This effort, led by the National Park Service (NPS) in collaboration with local historians, tribal leaders, and conservation experts, marks a significant step in the trail’s journey toward comprehensive recognition and stewardship.  

### **What Is Ground-Truthing?**  
Ground-truthing involves physically verifying historical routes, landmarks, and other significant features on the trail by comparing archival maps, historical records, and oral histories with on-the-ground evidence. The goal is to pinpoint the precise path of the Butterfield Overland route, which operated as a vital stagecoach line between St. Louis, Missouri, and San Francisco, California, from 1858 to 1861.  

“This process is about aligning historical documentation with what remains on the landscape today,” said Emily Vasquez, a project lead with the NPS. “It’s a blend of history, archaeology, and modern technology, ensuring we preserve the trail’s authenticity for future generations.”  

### **Historic and Cultural Significance**  
The Butterfield Overland Trail was designated as a National Historic Trail in 2022, a testament to its importance in U.S. history. It not only facilitated communication and commerce during the pre-Civil War era but also connected diverse communities along its path.  

For many Native American tribes, the trail intersects with ancestral lands and cultural sites. Tribal leaders are working closely with the NPS to document and protect areas of significance. “This collaboration ensures the trail’s story reflects all its historical layers,” said Jonathan Redbird, a Cherokee Nation historian.  

### **Modern Tools in Historic Preservation**  
Ground-truthing efforts are leveraging advanced tools such as satellite imagery, GPS mapping, and drones. These technologies aid researchers in identifying remnants of stagecoach stops, wagon ruts, and other physical markers. However, local knowledge remains indispensable. Residents living near the trail often provide insights into landmarks and oral histories passed down through generations.  

### **Community Engagement and Public Awareness**  
Public involvement is another key aspect of the project. Workshops and volunteer opportunities invite communities to take part in documenting the trail. Local schools and historical societies are hosting events to educate the public about the trail’s legacy.  

“The Butterfield Trail is more than a historical artifact; it’s a living connection to our past,” said Vasquez. “Engaging the public fosters a sense of shared responsibility in preserving this national treasure.”  

### **Looking Ahead**  
Once the ground-truthing process is complete, the findings will inform the development of maps, educational materials, and preservation plans. The NPS also hopes to enhance visitor experiences by marking the trail’s route with interpretive signage and interactive resources.  

As work progresses, the Butterfield Overland National Trail continues to inspire appreciation for the people and events that shaped the United States. Through ground-truthing, this historical route is poised to tell its story more vividly than ever before.

"Nepali Asian Restaurant in Carrick ordered to close after inspectors find cockroach infestation.

A cockroach infestation, rotten food and raw pork chops dripping onto produce were among the findings Thursday that the Allegheny County Health Department says led it to order Nepali Asian Restaurant to close.

The Nepalese restaurant in Pittsburgh’s Carrick neighborhood, which opened in 2018, racked up 22 violations, including six deemed “high-risk” by inspectors.

The health department found dead fruit flies in flour bags and dangerous meat storage practices as well as live cockroaches in a dry storage room — “too many to count,” the report noted.

Cockroaches also were observed in and around coolers, dishwashers, restrooms and other areas of the building.

In addition, inspectors discovered a lack of dish detergent or sanitizer.

The restaurant must eliminate pests, implement proper food storage practices and take other steps toward cleaning and maintaining the restaurant in order to pass re-inspection and be able to reopen.

A call to the restaurant seeking comment was not immediately returned.

Any restaurants found to have violations that warrant a consumer alert or closure are posted online. Full inspection reports also are available on the website.",https://triblive.com/local/nepali-asian-restaurant-in-carrick-ordered-to-close-after-inspectors-find-cockroach-infestation/,real,0
"Nepali Asian Restaurant in Carrick ordered to close after inspectors find cockroach infestation.

Carrick, January 12, 2025 — A popular Nepali Asian restaurant in Carrick has been forced to shut its doors after health inspectors discovered a severe cockroach infestation during a routine inspection.

The restaurant, which has been a local favorite for its authentic Nepali and Asian fusion dishes, was visited by inspectors earlier this week. According to the health department's report, evidence of live cockroaches was found in the kitchen, food storage areas, and dining spaces, raising serious concerns about food safety and hygiene standards.

In addition to the infestation, inspectors also noted unsanitary conditions, including improper food storage and inadequate cleaning practices. The report stated that these violations posed an ""imminent health risk"" to the public, prompting the immediate closure order.

“This type of health violation cannot be taken lightly,” said a spokesperson from the Carrick Health Department. “We are committed to ensuring public safety and will only allow the restaurant to reopen once it meets the required standards.”

The restaurant owner issued a statement expressing regret over the situation and assured customers that efforts are underway to address the issues. “We deeply apologize to our valued patrons. Our priority is to resolve these concerns and implement strict measures to ensure this does not happen again.”

The restaurant will remain closed until it passes a follow-up inspection confirming that all health violations have been resolved.

Residents are encouraged to report any concerns about food safety at local establishments to the Carrick Health Department hotline.",create a small news article with the title: Nepali Asian Restaurant in Carrick ordered to close after inspectors find cockroach infestation,fake,1
